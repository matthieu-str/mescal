For example, ecoinvent is an LCI database (Wernet et al., 2016).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

An exchange of a certain activity can be between the activity and the environment (elementary exchange, for example CO2 emission to air) or between two activities (intermediate exchange, for example wastewater to be released from one activity to another—treatment of wastewater)._ (ecoinvent glossary)                                                                                                        |

In the present work, we contextualize the previous definition as follows: the foreground system is defined as the set of energy technologies and resources in the ESM, i.e., processes of the energy system of the location of interest.                                                                                            |

In the present work, we contextualize the previous definition as follows: the background system represents other processes, i.e., which are not part of the energy system and/or which are outside of the ESM geographical scope.                                                     |
| Market-type dataset       | Market activity                                         | _A market activity transfers a product or service (intermediate exchange) from one or more transforming activities that produce it, to the transforming activities that consume it. [...] A market activity therefore provides the average consumption mix of a product for a given region, and the marginal consumption mix in the case of system models that use marginal suppliers._ (ecoinvent glossary)                                           |
| Inventory spatialization  |                                                         | _Attribution of a geographic location to an EF, which is inherited from the process it stems from. This geographic location is necessary when using regionalized CFs. Different types of geographic information may be used (specific geographical coordinates, administrative region, archetypes, etc.) and eventually match the native spatial resolution of the impact method._ (Patouillard et al., 2018)                                          |
| Inventory regionalization |                                                         | _Improvement of the geographic representativeness of inventory data (type and quantity of economic flows and EFs) to be more representative of specific geographic areas in the product life cycle._ (Patouillard et al., 2018)                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

LCIA method developers determine the optimal spatial scale, called the native resolution, for a given impact category by considering the spatial variability of the LCIA model parameters and most influential mechanisms. The native resolution may be defined using geographic differentiation or archetypes._ (Patouillard et al., 2018) |
| Impact category           |                                                         | _Class representing environmental issue of concern (ISO 14040). E.g. Climate change, Acidification, Ecotoxicity etc._ (Benini et al., 2014)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

E.g. kg CO2-equivalents for climate change._ (Benini et al., 2014)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

For this reason, these models can also be called recursive. The decider has not thus a complete information on the whole horizon, leading to decisions in a certain step sub-optimal with regards of what happens in the following steps. This last approach is more realistic as in reality the decisions are taken without a complete information about the future changes. However, the decider could be misguided in the first time-steps due to its limited knowledge and may not be capable to repair the early wrong decisions in the following steps._ (Prina et al., 2020) |
