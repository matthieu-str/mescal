For example, ecoinvent is an LCI database (Wernet et al., 2016).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In the present work, we contextualize the previous definition as follows: the foreground system is defined as the set of energy technologies and resources in the ESM, i.e., processes of the energy system of the location of interest.                                                                                            |

In the present work, we contextualize the previous definition as follows: the background system represents other processes, i.e., which are not part of the energy system and/or which are outside of the ESM geographical scope.                                                     |
| Market-type dataset       | Market activity                                         | _A market activity transfers a product or service (intermediate exchange) from one or more transforming activities that produce it, to the transforming activities that consume it. [...] A market activity therefore provides the average consumption mix of a product for a given region, and the marginal consumption mix in the case of system models that use marginal suppliers._ (ecoinvent glossary)                                           |

This geographic location is necessary when using regionalized CFs. Different types of geographic information may be used (specific geographical coordinates, administrative region, archetypes, etc.) and eventually match the native spatial resolution of the impact method._ (Patouillard et al., 2018)                                          |

LCIA method developers determine the optimal spatial scale, called the native resolution, for a given impact category by considering the spatial variability of the LCIA model parameters and most influential mechanisms. The native resolution may be defined using geographic differentiation or archetypes._ (Patouillard et al., 2018) |

| Pathway model              | Evolution model, transition model | _Evolution energy models analyse the evolution of a national energy system over a time horizon. The time horizon extends from the initial year to the end year and is broken down into a series of multiple-year or single-year periods. Each period is in turn subdivided into time-slices. Time-slices represent time intervals with similar conditions (i.e. weekends in winter, Monday mornings in summer, etc), with the purpose of better capturing seasonal, weekly or daily variations in energy supply and demand._ (Codina Girones et al, 2015)                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Perfect-foresight approach |                                   | _Perfect-foresight approach is based on the assumption that the decision-makers have complete knowledge on the whole transition. Thus, they have full information on cost trends, consumption variation, decay of performance of certain technologies, future decommissioning of power plants, future improvement of the efficiencies of certain technologies, etc. This approach is realized through the formulation of a unique optimization problem analyzing all the time-periods simultaneously. These models can also be classified as intertemporal models._ (Prina et al., 2020)                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Myopic approach            |                                   | _The myopic approach is instead characterized by the time-horizon divided into a sequence of optimization problems where the output of the prior serves as input for the following. For this reason, these models can also be called recursive. The decider has not thus a complete information on the whole horizon, leading to decisions in a certain step sub-optimal with regards of what happens in the following steps. This last approach is more realistic as in reality the decisions are taken without a complete information about the future changes. However, the decider could be misguided in the first time-steps due to its limited knowledge and may not be capable to repair the early wrong decisions in the following steps._ (Prina et al., 2020) |
