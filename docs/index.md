## What is Mescal?

Mescal is a Python package for the creation and management of life-cycle inventory databases and metrics derived from life-cycle assessment, to be integrated in decision-making tools such as energy system models.

Mescal is a specialized package of the [Brightway Software Framework](https://brightway.dev/), mainly relying on the [bw2calc](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-calc) and [wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst) Python packages.

Mescal was designed for all researchers and modellers aiming to include life-cycle assessment (LCA) in their work, but who are not necessarily LCA experts. Mescal is usually used within [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
