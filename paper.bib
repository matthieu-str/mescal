  abstract = {Scenarios are commonly used to evaluate the environmental implications of future alternative energy pathways - they provide a benchmark for policy-makers to evaluate social, economic or environmental tradeoffs of various policies and their benefits to society. However, scenarios may leave policy-makers incognizant of potential technological hurdles, economic costs, or unforeseen environmental consequences of energy pathways, prior to venturing into long-term, binding decisions. Herein, we present a framework to bridge global socioeconomic scenarios with in situ energy policy assumptions to ensure technological alternatives can be evaluated and compared relative to realistic techno-economic constraints, environmental tradeoffs, and potential vulnerabilities arising from climate stress. We integrate downscaled Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) with prospective Life Cycle Assessment as a framework to understand the technical specifications, i.e. raw materials, energy inputs, and environmental impacts, of alternative energy policy assumptions. We apply our integrated framework to understand the technological implications, particularly greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, of future energy policies surrounding the practice of hydraulic fracturing in Texas, and the implications of potential adaptive responses to climate change. Results indicated that trade-offs between water conservation and greenhouse gas mitigation are inherent to hydraulic fracturing processes, necessitating careful consideration of technology options to balance environmental objectives.},

  abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmentally extended input--output analyses (EEIOA) are two techniques commonly used to assess environmental impacts of an activity/product. Their strengths and weaknesses are complementary, and they are thus regularly combined to obtain hybrid LCAs. A number of approaches in hybrid LCA exist, which leads to different results. One of the differences is the method used to ensure that mixed LCA and EEIOA data do not overlap, which is referred to as correction for double counting. This aspect of hybrid LCA is often ignored in reports of hybrid assessments and no comprehensive study has been carried out on it. This article strives to list, compare, and analyze the different existing methods for the correction of double counting. We first harmonize the definitions of the existing correction methods and express them in a common notation, before introducing a streamlined variant. We then compare their respective assumptions and limitations. We discuss the loss of specific information regarding the studied activity/product and the loss of coherent financial representation caused by some of the correction methods. This analysis clarifies which techniques are most applicable to different tasks, from hybridizing individual LCA processes to integrating complete databases. We finally conclude by giving recommendations for future hybrid analyses.},

  abstract = {IMPACT World+ is a life cycle impact assessment method which characterizes thousands of substances spanning across various compartments and sub-compartments of the environment. It differentiates 19 impact categories at midpoint level and 34 impact categories at damage level. For more information on IW+, refer to our website and scientific article. For information on the updates of IMPACT World+, you can register to the newsletter of CIRAIG. The v2.1 update is the biggest update of the IMPACT World+ method in many years as it introduces new impact categories and updates many models with the latest available research. IMPACT World+ comes in three interpretation levels: midpoint, expert and footprint. You can find explanations for these three interpretation levels here. The expert and midpoint versions of IMPACT World+ also come with two different implementations regarding how to account for biogenic carbon. One with the traditional biogenic carbon neutrality approach (e.g., where biogenic carbon dioxide is set at 0 and biogenic methane is set at 27kgCO2eq for GWP100) and one including the uptake of biogenic carbon dioxide, where the release of biogenic carbon is therefore set at the same CFs as fossil carbon, but the uptake is with a negative sign, i.e., a -1/+1 approach for biogenic carbon (look for the files marked ``(incl. CO2 uptake)''). While we provide the -/+1 approach, we must make it clear to the users that this approach is heavily dependent on the quality of the inventory you are using, and that there are still issues currently with the LCI databases (even in ecoinvent 3.10). Furthermore, if you are using this approach, you either MUST adopt a cradle-to-grave approach to both account for the uptake and release of biogenic carbon (otherwise you will only account for the uptake of the carbon and have skewed results) or if you adopt a cradle-to-gate approach because you need to provide results to someone downstream of your supply chain you MUST communicate with that downstream user to tell them that they should account for the release of biogenic carbon in a -1/+1 approach also, otherwise, you and your downstream user will double count the benefits of using biogenic products, which is incorrect. This is especially true is the case of food products where the carbon emissions post consumption are typically not included in the inventories, which could result in a substantial under estimation of the impacts of this product over its life cycle. Description of the files - The dev file is a file useful for developers and maintainers of databases/datasets who wish to link IW+ 2.1 to their databases/datasets. It regroups all existing characterization factors of the IW+ LCIA method in an Excel format, using the terminology of IW+. - The "ecoinvent" files are Excel files matching with "pure" ecoinvent and its flow name terminology (as in unaltered by various software) in an Excel table. This is useful if you are using ecoinvent outside of LCA software. - The exiobase file links IW+ to the Exiobase GMRIO database. Once the file is read through pandas (pandas.read\_excel()), the resulting matrix can directly be multiplied to the environmental extensions of exiobase (S, F or F\_Y if using the pymrio package). - The openLCA file can be directly imported in the openLCA software as a JSON-LD file. - The SimaPro file can be directly imported in the SimaPro software as a CSV file. - The brightway2 files are ecoinvent-version dependent, so you need to select the correct file to work with the correct version of ecoinvent. Else, some of the ecoinvent flows which name did change in between versions of ecoinvent would not be characterized, leading to underestimated results. To import a file, you need to pass through brightway2 itself (it cannot be done through the activity-browser for now). The function to import a .bw2package file is bw2.BW2Package.import\_file(). - Finally, the source file regroups all the native information used by IW+ to derive the characterization factors. This file is primarily useful for the IW+ internal team. It is provided for transparency, as well as for curious users or users who wish to generate all these files themselves through the open-access code of IW+. New indicators - Plastic physical effect on biota This new indicator measures the effect of plastic resins emitted in the water environments (both freshwater and marine) on biota, in PDF.m2.yr. It also comes with a midpoint indicator in CTUe. This indicator is the result of the work of the MariLCA working group. - Fisheries impact This new indicator measures the impact on biodiversity of fisheries activities. It is only assessed at the ecosystem quality damage level (in PDF.m2.yr). This is based on the work of Stanford-Clark et al. - Marine ecotoxicity In the v2.1 we decided to finally integrate these two ecotoxicity indicators, at the damage level only. These are based on an old version of Usetox (v2.02). As the v3 of Usetox is on the verge of being released, all ecotoxicity and toxicity categories will be updated in the next version of IW+. - Terrestrial ecotoxicity In the v2.1 we decided to finally integrate these two ecotoxicity indicators, at the damage level only. These are based on an old version of Usetox (v2.02). As the v3 of Usetox is on the verge of being released, all ecotoxicity and toxicity categories will be updated in the next version of IW+. - Photochemical ozone formation For this impact category, IW+ adopts what the ReCiPe methodology recommends. In their 2016 update, ReCiPe renamed the indicator "Photochemical oxidant formation" to "Photochemical ozone formation". In addition, they calculated the impact of this category on ecosystem quality. There are thus two corresponding impact categories at damage level: "Photochemical ozone formation, human health" and "Photochemical ozone formation, ecosystem quality" Updated indicators - All climate change indicators IMPACT World+ v2.1 proposes the carbon neutrality approach (i.e., CO2-bio = 0) as well as the -1/+1 approach (CO2-bio uptake = -1 / CO2-bio release = +1). However, the latter is only available in the expert and midpoint versions. In the footprint version, the carbon neutrality assumption is still being used. Furthermore, we added CFs for temporary storage of biogenic carbon that can be used (e.g., Correction for delayed emissions, carbon dioxide, biogenic). - Climate change, human health In the v2.0.1, we updated the GWP100 and GTP100 indicators following the recommendations of the AR6 from the IPCC2021. Now in the v2.1, we are also updating our damage indicators for climate change to follow the AR6 recommendations. Notably, the cumulative AGTP500 used in the derivation of these CFs was recalculated with updated equations (which we obtained thanks to Yue He and Thomas Gasser from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis - IIASA). In addition, the effect factors were also updated. Previously it was based on data from the World Health Organization from 2003, it is now based on the WHO 2014 report as well as the work of L. Rupcic. - Climate change, ecosystem quality Similarly to the human health indicator the cumulative AGTP500 were recalculated. However, the effect factor was not updated yet for this impact category. - Particulate matter formation Those CFs were updated to the latest model from Fantke, et al. This is composed of a series of articles on updates to fate and effect factors This model now provides regionalized characterization factors per town of more than 100,000 inhabitants. The CFs at the town-level are available in the source file, but in the dev file and in the different software versions, we only provide national/regional (e.g., RER) as well as global values, aggregated from the town-level factors. - Water availability, human health Those CFs were updated to the latest model of L. Debarre (2024) [publication in review, link will be added once published]. This model includes a harmonization of methodology between the domestic and agriculture water use, updates the exposition factors using the latest Gross National Income data and updates the EF. Overall, the values of the characterization factors of this category have dramatically decreased, by a minimum of 65\%. - Water availability, terrestrial ecosystems While the original value of the characterization was not updated (e.g., 0.21 PDF.m2.yr in Netherlands), the regionalization was updated based on an estimation of depths of groundwater, based on Jasechko (2021). - Water scarcity Those CFs were updated to the latest update of the AWARE model Seitfudem (2024) [publication in review, link will be added once published]. - Fossil and nuclear energy use The HHV values were updated to match the updated HHVs in ecoinvent. - Ozone layer depletion Those CFs were adapted to match the latest data from the World Meteorological Organization (2022). In addition, the time horizon has now been extended to the infinite instead of limiting it to 500 years. Methodology For more detail on the methodology behind each impact category, refer to our Github, in the future it will be available directly on our website. Corrections In this section we only provide information on the major corrections that were made. For a full report of all the changes please refer to out Github. - There are challenges associated with using IMPACT World+ files across databases or software for which they were not specifically designed. For instance, this is why we now provide files adapted to particular ecoinvent versions in brightway2. Similarly, both SimaPro and openLCA periodically update the names of their elementary flows. When an impact assessment method has previously been imported into one of these tools, an embedded procedure in their update processes is supposed to adjust the characterization factor names in line with the new flow names, ensuring compatibility with the updated list. However, we lack detailed knowledge of this procedure, meaning we cannot guarantee that the updated versions of IW+ in these tools would align with our specific modeling choices. Likewise, the IW+ versions we provide for a given release of SimaPro or openLCA might be incompatible with previous or subsequent versions due to discrepancies in flow names and characterization factors. Consequently, users of these software should verify which flows are characterized and make adjustments if necessary. - Harmonization of regionalized flows Regionalized impact model do not operate at the same geographical granularity. In the previous version, some flows were characterized in one impact category but not in the other. For instance, the flow "Water, lake, US-TRE" was characterized for the "water scarcity" indicator but not for "Water availability, human health". All regionalized flows are now characterized for all the impact categories they affect. This is also true for the newest regionalized impact category (Particulate matter formation) where SO2 for example is regionalized at a much more granular level than in the freshwater acidification impact category. - Fossil and nuclear energy use For the SimaPro version of the v2.0.1, some flows that only exist in SimaPro were not characterized, such as "Oil, crude, 43.4 MJ per kg". Now they are properly characterized using the energy content value specified in the name. Results obtained with SimaPro will thus differ from results obtained with brightway2 and openLCA, since the latter do not use such flows and only use flow such as "Oil, crude". - Thermally polluted water In the v2.0.1, the flows "Water, turbine use, unspecified natural origin" were not linked to the correct proxy, which meant they did not impact the Thermally polluted water category, which underestimated the impact of this category. - The problem of "Nitrogen" "Nitrogen" can mean two different things. It can literally mean the "N" element, but it can also mean the "N2" molecule. The issue is that it is not clear in the LCI databases, which meaning does "Nitrogen" have. Previously, our understanding was that "Nitrogen" meant "N" but since then, ecoinvent notably, added formulas to the elementary flows they provide and associated the formula "N2" to their "Nitrogen" flows, indicating that they understand it as "N2" and not "N". Furthermore, in SimaPro and openLCA, the associated CAS number is generally "7727-37-9" which again corresponds to "N2". Thus, we now consider that ``Nitrogen'' represents dinitrogen, and thus does not impact the "Marine eutrophication" impact category anymore. We also corrected a previous mistake: N2O is not characterized anymore for this impact category.},

  abstract = {Energy systems are currently designed focusing only on minimizing their cost or, at most, including limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, electricity technologies performing well in global warming potential might not necessarily behave equally well across other sustainability criteria. Hence, policies focused solely on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions could potentially resolve one problem (i.e., climate change) by creating another, thereby leading to burden-shifting. Here, the occurrence and severity of burden-shifting in energy systems design are both investigated through the application of a novel approach integrating multi-objective optimization, life cycle assessment and multivariate regression based on elasticities. Environmental impacts are classified into three categories: no burden-shifting, total burden-shifting and partial burden-shifting, providing for the latter two a measure of their severity. Due to inherent trade-offs in the life cycle performance of technologies, discussed in detail in this work, the Paris Agreement 2  C targets would lead to burden-shifting in the United States (total or partial) in up to eight environmental impacts. On the other hand, stringent carbon emissions reductions in line with the 1.5  C targets can lead to burden-shifting in three environmental impacts. Indeed, in both cases undesirable increases in some damage categories of up to 1.64\% for every percentage increase in cost can take place as a result of more stringent limits on greenhouse gas emissions compared to the least cost solution. Overall, this work aims to foster fruitful discussions on how to generate energy within the Earth's ecological capacity by expanding the analysis beyond climate change.},

  abstract = {Designing energy systems within planetary boundaries is crucial to preserving the Earth's ecological capacity given the power sector's environmental footprint.           ,              The concept of planetary boundaries identifies a safe space for humanity. Current energy systems are primarily designed with a focus on total cost minimization and bounds on greenhouse gas emissions. Omitting planetary boundaries in energy systems design can lead to energy mixes unable to power our sustainable development. To overcome this conceptual limitation, we here incorporate planetary boundaries into energy systems models, explicitly linking energy generation with the Earth's ecological limits. Taking the United States as a testbed, we found that the least cost energy mix that would meet the Paris Agreement 2 degrees Celsius target still transgresses five out of eight planetary boundaries. It is possible to meet seven out of eight planetary boundaries concurrently by incurring a doubling of the cost compared to the least cost energy mix solution (1.3\% of the United States gross domestic product in 2017). Due to the stringent downscaled planetary boundary on biogeochemical nitrogen flow, there is no energy mix in the United States capable of satisfying all planetary boundaries concurrently. Our work highlights the importance of considering planetary boundaries in energy systems design and paves the way for further research on how to effectively accomplish such integration in energy related studies.},

This limited environmental scope can lead to mixes that are not consistent with our sustainable development. To circumvent this limitation, we here make use of the concept of monetization and life cycle assessment to quantify the indirect costs of electricity generation in the design of energy systems. Applying our approach to the United States, we found that the indirect costs of electricity generation could be reduced by as much as 63\% by meeting the Paris Agreement. Consequently, the total opportunity cost (i.e., direct and indirect costs) of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and continuing with the current mix would be as high as 1103 {\textpm} 206 billion USD2013 in 2030 (i.e., 6\% of the United States gross domestic product in 2017). By optimizing the direct and indirect costs of electricity generation concurrently, we found an optimal ecological solution that attains total economic savings compared to the Paris Agreement mix of as much as 373 {\textpm} 164 billion USD2013 in 2030. Our work highlights the need to extend the environmental policies that regulate energy systems beyond the direct greenhouse emissions to consider other critical environmental criteria.},

We develop a general method for deriving coefficients from detailed, bottom-up LCA suitable for application in IA models, thus allowing IA analysts to explore the life cycle impacts of technology and scenario alternatives. The method decomposes LCA coefficients into life cycle phases and energy carrier use by industries, thus facilitating attribution of life cycle effects to appropriate years, and consistent and comprehensive use of IA model-specific scenario data when the LCA coefficients are applied in IA scenario modelling. We demonstrate the application of the method for global electricity supply to 2050 and provide numerical results (as supplementary material) for future use by IA analysts. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Uncertainties surrounding the energy transition often lead modelers to present large sets of scenarios that are challenging for policymakers to interpret and act upon. An alternative approach is to define a few qualitative storylines from stakeholder discussions, which can be affected by biases and infeasibilities. Leveraging decision trees, a popular machine-learning technique, we derive interpretable storylines from many quantitative scenarios and show how the key decisions in the energy transition are interlinked. Specifically, our results demonstrate that choosing a high deployment of renewables and sector coupling makes global decarbonization scenarios robust against uncertainties in climate sensitivity and demand. Also, the energy transition to a fossil-free Europe is primarily determined by choices on the roles of bioenergy, storage, and heat electrification. Our transferrable approach translates vast energy model results into a small set of critical decisions, guiding decision-makers in prioritizing the key factors that will shape the energy transition.},

The emission quotas and CDR activities obtained in the solution of this steady-state model could then be used as a target for end-of-period conditions in a dynamic integrated assessment analysis studying the transition to 2100. More precisely, we analyze a steady-state situation where m coalitions exist and behave as m players in a game of supplying emission rights on an international emission trading system. The quotas supplied by a coalition must correspond to the amount of CO2 captured through CDR activities in the corresponding world region. We use an extension of the computable general equilibrium model GEMINI-E3 to calibrate the payoff functions and compute an equilibrium solution in the noncooperative game.},

Comparability is supposed to be further increased by developing product category specific rules (PEFCRs). The aim of this paper is to evaluate if the main goal of the PEF method has been achieved. This is done by a comprehensive analysis of the PEF guide, the current PEFCR guide, the developed PEFCRs, as well as the insights gained from participating in the pilot phase. The analysis reveals that the PEF method as well as its implementation in PEFCRs are not able to guarantee fair comparability due to shortcomings related to the (1) definition of product performance; (2) definition of the product category; (3) definition and determination of the representative product; (4) modeling of electricity; (5) requirements for the use of secondary data; (6) circular footprint formula; (7) life cycle impact assessment methods; and (8) approach to prioritize impact categories. For some of these shortcomings, recommendations for improvement are provided. This paper demonstrates that the PEF method has to be further improved to guarantee fair comparability.},

Circular strategies have been proposed for plastics to achieve net-zero GHG emissions. However, the implications of such circular strategies on absolute sustainability have not been examined on a planetary scale. This study links a bottom-up model covering both the production and end-of-life treatment of 90\% of global plastics to the planetary boundaries framework. Here we show that even a circular, climate-optimal plastics industry combining current recycling technologies with biomass utilization transgresses sustainability thresholds by up to four times. However, improving recycling technologies and recycling rates up to at least 75\% in combination with biomass and CO               2               utilization in plastics production can lead to a scenario in which plastics comply with their assigned safe operating space in 2030. Although being the key to sustainability and in improving the unquantified effect of novel entities on the biosphere, even enhanced recycling cannot cope with the growth in plastics demand predicted until 2050. Therefore, achieving absolute sustainability of plastics requires a fundamental change in our methods of both producing and using plastics.},

In this context, adaptation measures can play an important role in reducing climate impacts. These measures involve adjustments to economic or social structures to limit the impact of climate change without limiting climate change itself. To assess the interplay of adaptation and mitigation, we develop AD-MERGE, an integrated assessment model that includes both reactive (`flow') and proactive (`stock') adaptation strategies as well as a range of mitigation (energy) technologies. We find that applying adaptation optimally delays but does not prevent the transition to clean energy systems (carbon capture and sequestration systems, nuclear, and renewables). Moreover, applying both adaptation and mitigation is more effective than using just one.},

  abstract = {A multi-period mixed-integer linear programming model has been developed to help explore future pathways for electricity supply where costs and carbon reduction are a priority. The model follows a life cycle approach and can optimise on costs and on a number of environmental objectives. To illustrate the application, the model has been optimised on two objectives: whole system costs and global warming potential (GWP) using the UK as an example. Four different scenarios have been considered up to 2060, each assuming different electricity demand and carbon reduction targets. When optimising on system costs, they range from {\pounds}156.6 bn for the least carbon-constrained scenario with moderate increase in electricity demand to {\pounds}269.9 bn for the scenario with high demand and requiring 100\% decarbonisation of electricity supply by 2035. In optimisation on GWP, negative carbon emissions are achieved in all scenarios, ranging from {\`A}0.5 to {\`A}1.28 Gt CO2 eq. over the period, owing to biomass carbon capture and storage. Optimising on the GWP also reduces significantly other environmental impacts at costs comparable to optimised costs. This research shows that meeting carbon targets will require careful planning and consideration of objectives other than costs alone to ensure that optimal rather than suboptimal solutions are found for a more sustainable electricity supply.},

This article presents a comprehensive life-cycle assessment (LCA) of electricity generation and supply for the Italian current mix and future scenarios, for a wide set of environmental impacts and indicators, addressing intra-year variations, and including average and marginal demand impact perspectives. The generation mix was modelled for a 3-year period (2018--2020) with hourly and country-specific data, for the main generation technologies; and two future scenarios (for 2030) were modelled applying the EPLANopt energy system model. While future scenarios - with larger renewable energy shares - resulted in reduced environmental impacts in most categories, they were associated with burden shifts. In particular, increased shares of solar photovoltaic generation in future scenarios resulted in significant contributions to mineral and metal resource depletion and to land use impacts. The high penetration of renewable energy sources in future scenarios was also associated with important seasonal and hourly variations, demonstrating the importance of addressing intra-year temporal variations. Moreover, complementing an average with a marginal demand perspective provided insight on potential impacts of demand changes. When considering a marginal demand perspective, future scenarios offered no clear benefits in terms of global warming, for example. The research demonstrated the need for comprehensive and detailed environmental impact assessments with fine time resolution, which can assess seasonal and intra-daily variations, and the evaluation of environmental im\- pacts with both average and marginal demand perspectives highlighted the complementary nature of the two in providing insightful results. The approach is fully replicable to other countries and regions - it can improve LCAs of electricity generation and supply and provide robust results to adequately inform decision-making on elec\- tricity generation and demand management, toward more sustainable energy systems.},

The model provides detailed environmental impacts for electricity, heat, and transport processes in Germany for meeting the climate targets up to 2050. Our results show that renewable energies and storage are key technologies for decarbonized energy systems. Furthermore, sector coupling is crucial and doubles electricity demand. Our LCA shows that environmental impacts shift from operation to infrastructure highlighting the importance of an impact assessment over the full life cycle. Decarbonization leads to many environmental cobenefits; however, it also increases freshwater ecotoxicity and depletion of metal and mineral resources.

REMIND,as an integrated assessment model (IAM), provides an integrated view of theglobal energy--economy--emissions system and explores self-consistenttransformation pathways. It describes a broad range of possible futures andtheir relation to technical and socio-economic developments as well aspolicy choices. REMIND is a multiregional model incorporating the economyand a detailed representation of the energy sector implemented in theGeneral Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). It uses non-linear optimization toderive welfare-optimal regional transformation pathways of theenergy-economic system subject to climate and sustainability constraints forthe time horizon from 2005 to 2100. The resulting solution corresponds to thedecentralized market outcome under the assumptions of perfect foresight ofagents and internalization of external effects. REMIND enables the analyses oftechnology options and policy approaches for climate change mitigation withparticular strength in representing the scale-up of new technologies,including renewables and their integration in power markets. The REMIND codeis organized into modules that gather code relevant for specific topics.Interaction between different modules is made explicit via clearly definedsets of input and output variables. Each module can be represented by differentrealizations, enabling flexible configuration and extension. The spatialresolution of REMIND is flexible and depends on the resolution of the inputdata. Thus, the framework can be used for a variety of applications in acustomized form, balancing requirements for detail and overall runtime andcomplexity.},

New prospective (or ex ante) methods are needed to assess the impacts of these changes. Prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) can contribute by detailed analysis of environmental consequences. A new stream of research has taken up the challenge to create prospective life cycle inventory (LCI) databases, building on projections of integrated assessment models to describe future changes in technology use and their underlying environmental performance. The present work extends on this by addressing the research question on how to project life cycle impact assessment methods for water scarcity consistent with prospective LCI modeling. Water scarcity characterization factors are projected from 2010--2050 using the AWARE method, based on SSP-RCP scenario results of the integrated assessment model IMAGE. This work is coupled with prospective LCI databases, where electricity datasets are adapted based on the energy component of IMAGE for the same scenario. Based on this, an LCA case study of water desalination for the steel industry in Spain is presented. The resulting regional characterization factors show that some regions (i.e., the Iberian Peninsula) could experience an increase in water scarcity in the future. Results of the case study show how this can lead to trade-offs between climate change and water scarcity impacts and how disregarding such trends could lead to biased assessments. The relevance and limitations are finally discussed, highlighting further research needs, such as the temporalization of the impacts.},

The study finds that two types of approaches, econometric and end-use accounting, are used in the existing energy demand models. Although energy demand models have greatly evolved since the early 1970s, key issues such as the poor-rich and urban-rural divides, traditional energy resources, and differentiation between commercial and non-commercial energy commodities are often poorly reflected in these models.},

  abstract = {The effects of amending municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) with carbon capture and storage (CCS) via MEA (Monoethanolamine) technology differ according to the air pollution control technologies and energy recovery systems. Electricity output reduces by one-third for power-only plants and halves for combined heat-and-power plants, while variations in heat recovery depend on the presence of flue gas condensation. MSWI with CCS can capture roughly 800 kg of compressed CO2 per tonne of waste treated. Life cycle assessment (LCA) modelling of MSWI, with and without CCS, illustrates that despite energy penalties, CCS lowers its climate change impact. The difference in climate change impacts as a result of CCS amendment depends on the energy system in which MSWI operates. In a near-future energy system, MSWI with CCS reduces climate change impacts by 700 kg CO2-eq/tonne wet waste compared to MSWI without CCS. The climate change saving of CCS became increasingly larger as the energy system became ``greener''; the climate change saving ultimately approached the capture efficiency (85\% of CO2 in the flue gas) multiplied by the carbon content of the waste converted to CO2. Sensitivity analysis showed that capture efficiency was the main factor affecting the overall results, with increasing importance in nonfossil fuel-based energy systems. Likely changes in residual waste composition, as source segregation and collection systems improve, had only minor effects on the environmental benefits of CCS. The effects of CCS amendments on 13 other impact categories were marginal compared to the effects of different MSWI configurations.},

While LCA provides a systematic framework for the environmental assessment and a wider systems perspective than what is required in SEA, LCA cannot address all aspects of environmental impact required, and therefore needs to be complemented by other tools.

  abstract = {In many regions and at the planetary scale, human pressures on the environment exceed levels that natural systems can sustain. These pressures are caused by networks of human activities, which often extend across countries and continents due to global trade. This has led to an increasing requirement for methods that enable absolute environmental sustainability assessment (AESA) of anthropogenic systems and which have a basis in life cycle assessment (LCA). Such methods enable the comparison of environmental impacts of products, companies, nations, etc, with an assigned share of environmental carrying capacity for various impact categories. This study is the first systematic review of LCA-based AESA methods and their applications. After developing a framework for LCA-based AESA methods, we identified 45 relevant studies through an initial survey, database searches and citation analysis. We characterized these studies according to their intended application, impact categories, basis of carrying capacity estimates, spatial differentiation of environmental model and principles for assigning carrying capacity. We then characterized all method applications and synthesized their results. Based on this assessment, we present recommendations to practitioners on the selection and use of existing LCA-based AESA methods, as well as ways to perform assessments and communicate results to decision-makers. Furthermore, we identify future research priorities intended to extend coverage of all components of the proposed method framework, improve modeling and increase the applicability of methods.},

  abstract = {As the EU energy system transitions to low carbon, the technology choices should consider a broader set of criteria. The use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) prevents burden shift across life cycle stages or impact categories, while the use of Energy System Models (ESM) allows evaluating alternative policies, capacity evolution and covering all the sectors. This study does an ex-post LCA analysis of results from JRC-EU-TIMES and estimates the environmental impact indicators across 18 categories in scenarios that achieve 80--95\% CO2 emission reduction by 2050. Results indicate that indirect CO2 emissions can be as large as direct ones for an 80\% CO2 reduction target and up to three times as large for 95\% CO2 reduction. Impact across most categories decreases by 20--40\% as the CO2 emission target becomes stricter. However, toxicity related impacts can become 35--100\% higher. The integrated framework was also used to evaluate the Power-to-Methane (PtM) system to relate the electricity mix and various CO2 sources to the PtM environmental impact. To be more attractive than natural gas, the climate change impact of the electricity used for PtM should be 123--181 gCO2eq/kWh when the CO2 comes from air or biogenic sources and 4--62 gCO2eq/kWh if the CO2 is from fossil fuels. PtM can have an impact up to 10 times larger for impact categories other than climate change. A system without PtM results in {\textasciitilde}4\% higher climate change impact and 9\% higher fossil depletion, while having 5--15\% lower impact for most of the other categories. This is based on a scenario where 9 parameters favor PtM deployment and establishes the upper bound of the environmental impact PtM can have. Further studies should work towards integrating LCA feedback into ESM and standardizing the methodology.},

Contrary to the ordinary liquid state, at supercritical conditions the hydrogen bond network is destabilized to various extents and the continuous breaking and reformation of hydrogen bonded structures allow large density and dipole fluctuations that, in turn, can significantly affect the dielectric properties of the solvent. Close to the critical point, where the density is very low, small clusters, mainly dimers and trimers, are the dominant features, but many molecules exhibit no H-bond. On the other hand, at higher densities, more extended structures appear, but still a continuous network cannot form. In both cases, H-bond configurations that are anomalous with respect to the normal liquid phase appear. These features strongly affect the solvent properties of supercritical water with respect to those of ambient water. They most likely vary continuously as a function of temperature, pressure and density and, hence, can be tuned to optimize the desired chemical process.},

Our primary objective is pedagogic. We first lay out the complementarity features of economic equilibrium and demonstrate how we can integrate bottom-up activity analysis into a top-down representation of the broader economy. We then provide a stylized numerical example of an integrated model --- within both static and dynamic settings. Finally, we present illustrative applications to three themes figuring prominently on the energy policy agenda of many industrialized countries: nuclear phase-out, green quotas, and environmental tax reforms.},

Currently discussed diversification options include the introduction of coal and nuclear power plants and/or an increased use of renewable energies. This article presents a methodology to assess different electricity system transformation strategies. By combining an electricity market model with a subsequent multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), we evaluate five power mix scenarios regarding power generation costs as well as non-economic dimensions such as energy security, environmental impact and social welfare effects. Based on criteria valuations obtained during consultations with Tunisian stakeholders, a final, bestranking electricity scenario was selected, consisting of 15\% wind, 15\% solar and 70\% natural gas-generated electricity in the national power mix by 2030.},

Damages from health impacting pollutants (NOx, SO2, particulate matter -- PM, and volatile organic compounds -- VOCs) as well as greenhouse gases (GHGs) are accounted for by applying emissions fees equal to estimated external damages associated with life-cycle emissions. We determine that in a least-cost framework, fees reduce emissions, including those not targeted by the fees. Emissions reductions are achieved through the use of control technologies, energy efficiency, and shifting of fuels and technologies used in energy conversion. The emissions targeted by fees decrease, and larger fees lead to larger reductions. Compared to the base case with no fees, in 2045, SO2 emissions are reduced up to 70\%, NOx emissions up to 30\%, PM2.5 up to 45\%, and CO2 by as much as 36\%. Emissions of some pollutants, particularly VOCs and methane, sometimes increase when fees are applied. The co-benefit of reduction in non-targeted pollutants is not always larger for larger fees. The degree of co-reduced emissions depends on treatment of life-cycle emissions and the technology pathway used to achieve emissions reductions, including the mix of efficiency, fuel switching, and emissions control technologies.},

For interactive optimization methods to be adopted in practice, computational frameworks are required, which can handle and visualize many objectives simultaneously, provide optimal solutions quickly and representatively, all while remaining simple and intuitive to use and understand by practitioners. Addressing these issues, this work introduces SAGESSE (Systematic Analysis, Generation, Exploration, Steering and Synthesis Experience), a decision support methodology, which relies on interactive multiobjective optimization. Its innovative aspects reside in the combination of (i) parallel coordinates as a means to simultaneously explore and steer the underlying alternative generation process, (ii) a Sobol sequence to efficiently sample the points to explore in the objective space, and (iii) on-the-fly application of multiattribute decision analysis, cluster analysis and other data visualization techniques linked to the parallel coordinates.

This research presents one of the first comparative reviews of mineral demand estimates for clean energy technologies and provides a meta-analysis of assumptions, model parameters, and key results.

  abstract = {Abstract. This paper describes GCAM v5.1, an open source model that represents the linkages between energy, water, land, climate, and economic systems. GCAM is a market equilibrium model, is global in scope, and operates from 1990 to 2100 in 5-year time steps. It can be used to examine, for example, how changes in population, income, or technology cost might alter crop production, energy demand, or water withdrawals, or how changes in one region's demand for energy affect energy, water, and land in other regions. This paper describes the model, including its assumptions, inputs, and outputs. We then use 11 scenarios, varying the socioeconomic and climate policy assumptions, to illustrate the results from the model. The resulting scenarios demonstrate a wide range of potential future energy, water, and land uses. We compare the results from GCAM v5.1 to historical data and to future scenario simulations from earlier versions of GCAM and from other models. Finally, we provide information on how to obtain the model.},

  abstract = {Description of the open-source MEDEAS integrated assessment modeling framework, which focuses on the biophysical and economic dimensions, restrictions and interactions arising during energy transitions.           ,              A diversity of integrated assessment models (IAMs) coexists due to the different approaches developed to deal with the complex interactions, high uncertainties and knowledge gaps within the environment and human societies. This paper describes the open-source MEDEAS modeling framework, which has been developed with the aim of informing decision-making to achieve the transition to sustainable energy systems with a focus on biophysical, economic, social and technological restrictions and tackling some of the limitations identified in the current IAMs. MEDEAS models include the following relevant characteristics: representation of biophysical constraints to energy availability; modeling of the mineral and energy investments for the energy transition, allowing a dynamic assessment of the potential mineral scarcities and computation of the net energy available to society; consistent representation of climate change damages with climate assessments by natural scientists; integration of detailed sectoral economic structure (input--output analysis) within a system dynamics approach; energy shifts driven by physical scarcity; and a rich set of socioeconomic and environmental impact indicators. The potentialities and novel insights that this framework brings are illustrated by the simulation of four variants of current trends with the MEDEAS-world model: the consideration of alternative plausible assumptions and methods, combined with the feedback-rich structure of the model, reveal dynamics and implications absent in classical models. Our results suggest that the continuation of current trends will drive significant biophysical scarcities and impacts which will most likely derive in regionalization (priority to security concerns and trade barriers), conflict, and ultimately, a severe global crisis which may lead to the collapse of our modern civilization. Despite depicting a much more worrying future than conventional projections of current trends, we however believe it is a more realistic counterfactual scenario that will allow the design of improved alternative sustainable pathways in future work.},

  abstract = {To achieve the European Union's target for climate neutrality by 2050 reduced energy demand will make the transition process faster and cheaper. The role of policies that support energy efficiency measures and demandside management practices will be critical and to ensure that energy demand models are relevant to policymakers and other end-users, understanding how to further improve the models and whether they are tailored to user needs to support efficient decision-making processes is crucial. So far though, no scientific studies have examined the key user needs for energy demand modelling in the context of the climate neutrality targets. In this article we address this gap using a multi-method approach based on empirical and desk research. Through survey and stakeholder meetings and workshops we identify user needs of different stakeholder groups, and we highlight the direction in which energy demand models need to be improved to be relevant to their users. Through a detailed review of existing energy demand models, we provide a full understanding of the key characteristics and ca\- pabilities of existing tools, and we identify their limitations and gaps. Our findings show that classical demandrelated questions remain important to model users, while most of the existing models can answer these questions. Furthermore, we show that some of the user needs related to sectoral demand modelling, dictated by the latest policy developments, are under-researched and are not addressed by existing tools.},

An IES using gas turbine, solar photo\- voltaics (PV), heat pumps, electrical cooling, and energy storage units is proposed here to satisfy the electricity, cooling, and heating demands of a residential building. A multi-objective optimization approach is used to find the best solutions considering energy, supply-demand matching and exergo-environmental economic indices with life cycle assessment (LCA) in following electric mode. The maximum benefit from the IES studied is reached with a system yielding 53.08\% for energy savings, 99.88\% matching, and 43.50\% cost savings. The ideal scheme selected by the TOPSIS method has a higher annual total cost than the cost with conventional method, but has a better cost saving ratio, 41.81\%. A sensitivity analysis shows that a higher PV use would decrease the fuel consumption, but it would reduce the matching and economic performance. Similar to the effect of natural gas price, the off-grid electricity price has higher impact on the cost saving ratio, but lower influence on the specific exergo-environmental cost.},

The true roles of CCUS have to be validated from the perspective of integrated energy system with features of high penetration of uncertain renewable power and strong interactions among multiple energy generation, conversion and storage technologies. To this end, this paper proposes a stochastic power-heat-gas-carbon scheduling approach for the wind-solar-thermal-battery en\- ergy mix integrated with CCUS (WSTB-CCUS) to manage the operation of energy conversion devices and CCUS in a coordinated manner. Coal/biomass co-fired and natural gas fired cogeneration units integrated with carbon capture system are built to reflect complex relationship between fuel, power, heat and carbon. A stochastic optimization model based on chance-constrained programming is presented to fully consider the uncertainties of renewable power and load demands. Case study shows that the stochastic scheduling can reduce 7.25\% of average total operating costs compared with the deterministic scheduling by providing a more robust solution for the WSTB-CCUS. Discussions are then carried out to explore the roles of CCUS in carbon reduction, flexibility enhancement, negative emission and robustness improvement from the perspective of energy system operation through stochastic scheduling. The influences of other low carbon technologies on the operation of carbon capture are further discussed to provide more insight on the low carbon transformation of energy system.},

  abstract = {Purpose Uncertainty is present in many forms in life cycle assessment (LCA). However, little attention has been paid to analyze the variability that methodological choices have on LCA outcomes. To address this variability, common practice is to conduct a sensitivity analysis, which is sometimes treated only at a qualitative level. Hence, the purpose of this paper was to evaluate the uncertainty and the sensitivity in the LCA of swine production due to two methodological choices: the allocation approach and the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method. Methods We used a comparative case study of swine production to address uncertainty due to methodological choices. First, scenario variation through a sensitivity analysis of the approaches used to address the multi-functionality problem was conducted for the main processes of the system product, followed by an impact assessment using five LCIA methods at the midpoint level. The results from the sensitivity analysis were used to generate 10,000 independent simulations using the Monte Carlo method and then compared using comparison indicators in histogram graphics. Results and discussion Regardless of the differences between the absolute values of the LCA obtained due to the allocation approach and LCIA methods used, the overall ranking of scenarios did not change. The use of the substitution method to address the multifunctional processes in swine production showed the highest values for almost all of the impact categories, except for freshwater ecotoxicity; therefore, this method introduced the greater variations into our analysis. Regarding the variation of the LCIA method, for acidification, eutrophication, and freshwater ecotoxicity, the results were very sensitive. The uncertainty analysis with the Monte Carlo simulations showed a wide range of results and an almost equal probability of all the scenarios be the preferable option to decrease the impacts on acidification, eutrophication, and freshwater ecotoxicity. Considering the aggregate result variation across allocation approaches and LCIA methods, the uncertainty is too high to identify a statistically significant alternative. Conclusions The uncertainty analysis showed that performing only a sensitivity analysis could mislead the decision-maker with respect to LCA results; our analysis with the Monte Carlo simulation indicates no significant difference between the alternatives compared. Although the uncertainty in the LCA outcomes could not be decreased due to the wide range of possible results, to some extent, the uncertainty analysis can lead to a less uncertain decision-making by demonstrating the uncertainties between the compared alternatives.},

  abstract = {The recent geopolitical conflicts in Europe have underscored the vulnerability of the current energy system to the volatility of energy carrier prices. In the prospect of defining robust energy systems ensuring sustainable energy supply in the future, the imperative of leveraging renewable indigenous energy sources becomes evident. However, as such technologies are integrated into the existing system, it is necessary to shift from the current centralized infrastructure to a decentralized production strategy. This paper presents a method to identify a panel of technological solutions at the district level, intended to reduce complexity for the integration of decentralized models into a national-scale model. The framework's novelty lies in combining a global sensitivity analysis for solution generation with clustering to identify typical configurations. The global sensitivity analysis is performed on a mixed integer linear programming model, which optimally sizes and operates district energy systems. The sensitivity analysis determines the most influential parameters of the model using the Morris method and provides a representative sampling of the solution space by leveraging the Sobol sampling strategy. The latter is then clustered using a density-based algorithm to identify typical solutions. The framework is applied to a suburban and residential Swiss neighborhood. The first outcome of the research is the high sensitivity of the model to energy carrier prices. As a result, Sobol's sampling space separates itself into two system types: those based on a natural gas boiler and those relying on a combination of electrical heaters and heat pumps. For both types, the electricity demand is either fulfilled by PV panels or electricity imports. The identified configurations showcase that the framework successfully generates a panel of solutions composed of various system configurations and operations being representative of the overall solution space.},

The uncertainty factors are aggregated to the standard deviation. This approach allows calculating uncertainties for all flows in the ecoinvent database. In ecoinvent 2 the uncertainty factors were provided based on expert judgment, without (documented) empirical foundation. This paper presents (1) a procedure to obtain an empirical foundation for the uncertainty factors that are used in the pedigree approach and (2) a proposal for new uncertainty factors, received by applying the developed procedure. Both the factors and the procedure are a result of a first phase of an ecoinvent project to refine the pedigree matrix approach. A separate paper in the same edition, also the result of the aforementioned project, deals with extending the developed approach to other probability distributions than lognormal (Muller et al.).},

The objective of this study is to present a methodology that combines probability and possibility theories to represent stochastic and epistemic uncertainties in a consistent manner and apply it to LCA.

Under current conditions, absolute sustainability is achievable under utilitarian sharing principles, utilizing hydrogen or ammonia as energy carrier, and relying on wind energy and storage at the source location. Looking ahead, cost-effective import pathways, powered by wind and solar energy, can achieve absolute sustainability from 2030 onward, when the world follows an optimistic sustainability pathway with ambitious climate mitigation targets. To attain absolute sustainability in other scenarios, improved practices and new materials in photovoltaic array design should be prioritized.},

Technology explicit energy system optimization models (ESOMs) are widely used to define and assess such low-carbon pathways, but these models only account for the emissions associated with energy combustion and either do not account for or do not correctly allocate emissions arising from infrastructure, manufacturing, construction and transport associated with energy technologies and fuels. This paper addresses this shortcoming, through a hybrid approach that estimates the upstream CO2 emissions across current and future energy technologies for the UK using a multiregional environmentally extended input-output model, and explicitly models the direct and indirect CO2 emissions of energy supply and infrastructure technologies within a national ESOM (the UK TIMES model). Results indicate the large significance of nondomestic indirect emissions, particularly coming from fossil fuel imports, and finds that the marginal abatement cost of mitigating all emissions associated with UK energy supply is roughly double that of mitigating only direct emissions in 2050.},

Using ESOMs to produce policy-relevant insight requires significant modeler judgement, yet little formal guidance exists on how to conduct analysis with ESOMs. To address this shortcoming, we draw on our collective modelling experience and conduct an extensive literature review to formalize best practice for energy system optimization modelling. We begin by articulating a set of overarching principles that can be used to guide ESOM-based analysis. To help operationalize the guiding principles, we outline and explain critical steps in the modelling process, including how to formulate research questions, set spatio-temporal boundaries, consider appropriate model features, conduct and refine the analysis, quantify uncertainty, and communicate insights. We highlight the need to develop and refine formal guidance on ESOM application, which comes at a critical time as ESOMs are being used to inform national climate targets.},

These models vary in structure, objectives, parameterization and level of detail, yielding differences in the computed energy and climate policy scenarios. To study model differences, diagnostic indicators are common practice in many academic fields, for example, in the physical climate sciences. However, they have not yet been applied systematically in mitigation literature, beyond addressing individual model dimensions. Here we address this gap by quantifying energy model typology along five dimensions: responsiveness, mitigation strategies, energy supply, energy demand and mitigation costs and effort, each expressed through several diagnostic indicators. The framework is applied to a diagnostic experiment with eight energy models in which we explore ten scenarios focusing on Europe. Comparing indicators to the ensemble yields comprehensive `energy model fingerprints', which describe systematic model behaviour and contextualize model differences for future multi-model comparison studies.},

Scenarios modeled an increase in installation power from 1800 MW in 2030 to 8000 MW in 2050. They were analyzed using energy modeling and life cycle assessment to assess the technical and environmental aspects of high PV grid penetration. The results showed that the increase in PV production from 2200 GWh (2030) to 11,090 GWh (2050) showed an unfavorable course of excess electricity in the system, resulting in the need for short-term and long-term storage strategies and exports of electricity. LCA analysis showed that penetration of a high share of PV results in a decrease in the impact category of global warming, which is higher in 2050 green scenarios that phase out coal and lignite electricity sources (80.5\% decrease) compared to the 2020 baseline scenario. The increase in mineral resource scarcity can be observed with an increase in PV share when comparing the 2030 (50\%) and 2050 (150\%) BAU scenarios with the baseline scenario (2020). Factors such as environmental impacts, technical challenges, and the impact on the grid must be considered when implementing a decarbonization strategy.},

We use a new linear programming optimization model to identify least-cost pathways to decarbonize Canada's electricity sector. We co-optimize investments in new generation, storage and transmission capacity, and the hourly dispatch of available assets over the course of a year. Our model includes hourly wind speed data for 2281 locations in Canada, hourly solar irradiation data from 199 Canadian meteorological stations, hourly demand data for each province, and inter- and intra-provincial transmission line data. We model the capacity of hydropower plants to store potential energy and respond to variations in renewable energy output and demand. We find that new transmission connections between provinces and a substantial expansion of wind power in high wind locations such as southern Saskatchewan and Alberta would allow Canada to reduce electricity sector emissions at the lowest cost. We find that hydropower plants and inter-provincial trade can provide important balancing services that allow for greater integration of variable wind power. We test the impact of carbon pricing on Canada's optimal electricity system and find that prices of \$80/tonne CO2e render the majority of Canada's coal-fired plants uneconomic.},

LCAs are however time-consuming and difficult to conduct for nonexperts, thus calling for simplified approaches for multicriteria environmental assessments. In this paper, a five-step protocol is presented to generate simplified arithmetic equations from a reference parametrized LCA model of an energy system and its application illustrated for an enhanced geothermal system for heat generation with very low direct emissions in continental Europe. The simplified models estimate seven environmental impacts (climate change, freshwater ecotoxicity, human health, minerals and metals, and fossil resources depletion, and acidification) based on six technological parameters: number of injection and production wells, power of the production and injection pump, average well length, thermal power output, and eight background parameters defining the European electricity mix. A global sensitivity analysis identified these parameters as influencing the variance of the environmental impacts the most. Ensuring the representativeness of the reference LCA model and the validity of the simplified models requires thorough assessment. This protocol allows to develop relevant alternatives to detailed LCAs for quick and multicriteria environmental impact assessments of energy systems, showing that LCAs can be simplified to system-specific equations based on few, easily quantified, parameters.},

Results and discussion We find that the ILCD handbook is internally inconsistent when it comes to recommendations on how to choose between attributional and consequential modeling. We also find that the handbook is inconsistent with much of previous research in this matter, and also in the recommendations on how to choose between average and marginal data in the LCI. Conclusions Because of the inconsistencies in the ILCD handbook, we recommend that the handbook be revised.},

EGTs however require several critical materials and materials associated with considerable energy, water and CO2 emissions. This paper assesses the implications of materials and energy efficiencies for climate change mitigation potential of global energy transition scenarios (GETS). The analysis is carried out using a dynamic material flow-stock model for 21 materials and 15 scenarios combining GETS developed by international organizations including International Energy Agency (IEA) and Greenpeace (GP), materials scenarios, and energy, water, and emissions intensities scenarios. Materials related CO2 emissions are expected to constitute between 4\% and 14\% the emissions reported in the IEA Sustainable Development scenario, while expected to be between 10\% and 28\% in GP Advanced Revolution scenario. Increasing material efficiency and reducing emissions intensities (driven by increasing energy efficiency, renewable technologies in energy supply mix, and recycling) reduce cumulative emissions by 73.2\% and 26.3\% respectively, while both reduce emissions by 79.5\%. Increasing materials efficiency in EGT, energy and water efficiency in mining activities mainly for iron, aluminium, and nickel, and recycling, combined with careful selection of EGTs are significant to realize the full potential of GETS in climate change mitigation.},

  abstract = {Global warming mitigation strategies are likely to affect human health and biodiversity through diverse cause-effect mechanisms. To analyze these effects, we implement a methodology to link TIMES energy models with life cycle assessment using open-source software. The proposed method uses a cutoff to identify the most relevant processes. These processes have their efficiencies, fuel mixes, and emission factors updated to be consistent with the TIMES model. The use of a cutoff criterion reduces exponentially the number of connection points between models, facilitating the analysis of scenarios with a large number of technologies involved. The method is used to assess the potential effects of deploying low-carbon technologies to reduce combustion emissions in the province of Quebec (Canada). In the case of Quebec, the reduction of combustion emissions is largely achieved through electrification of energy services. Global warming mitigation efforts reduce the impact on human health and ecosystem quality, mainly because of lower global warming, water scarcity, and metal contamination impacts. The TIMES model alone underestimated the reduction of CO2eq by 21\% with respect to a full account of emissions.},

The potentiality of this comprehensive data collection may be exploited also from an environmental point of view, with the aim to enhance the sustainability of processes; in fact, a large part of this data provides the basis for the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), the most energy and time-consuming phase of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) which in this way could become quicker and dynamic. Based on a case study related to an Italian ceramic tile manufacturer, the aim of this paper is to describe the architecture and the application of the Dynamic LCA system that integrates the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system with a customized LCA tool through a Business Intelligence (BI) software. The model was tested on different levels of validation in order to verify first the proper functioning of the IT architecture and then the environmental impact results provided, both in a static and dynamic way. The validation processes were successful, and the Dynamic LCA system has proved to be a valuable tool for the evaluation and monitoring of environmental impacts related to the production process.},

In this review, we present the normalized land requirements during the life cycles of conventional- and renewable-energy options, covering coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, photovoltaics, wind, and biomass. We compared the land transformation and occupation matrices within a life-cycle framework across those fuel cycles. Although the estimates vary with regional and technological conditions, the photovoltaic (PV) cycle requires the least amount of land among renewable-energy options, while the biomass cycle requires the largest amount. Moreover, we determined that, in most cases, ground-mount PV systems in areas of high insolation transform less land than the coal-fuel cycle coupled with surface mining. In terms of land occupation, the biomass-fuel cycle requires the greatest amount, followed by the nuclear-fuel cycle. Although not detailed in this review, conventional electricity-generation technologies also pose secondary effects on land use, including contamination and disruptions of the ecosystems of adjacent lands, and land disruptions by fuel-cycle-related accidents.},

In this study we propose an approach to aid such negotiations based on quantifying the benefits of interregional cooperation and distributing them among the participants in a fair manner. Our approach is underpinned by advanced optimisation techniques that automate the screening of millions of alternatives for differing levels of cooperation, ultimately identifying the most cost-effective solutions for meeting emission targets. We apply this approach to the Clean Power Plan, a related act in the U.S. aiming at curbing carbon emissions from electricity generation, but also being withdrawn. We find that, with only half of the states cooperating, the cost of electricity generation could be reduced by US\$41 billion per year, while simultaneously cutting carbon emissions by 68\% below 2012 levels. These win--win scenarios are attained by sharing the emission targets and trading electricity among the states, which allows exploiting regional advantages. Fair sharing of dividends may be used as a key driver to spur cooperation since the global action to mitigate climate change becomes beneficial for all participants. Even if global cooperation remains elusive, it is worth trying since the mere cooperation of a few states leads to significant benefits for both the U.S. economy and the climate. These findings call on the U.S. to reconsider its withdrawal but also boost individual states to take initiative even in the absence of federal action.},

The TIMES-Norway model is used, taking into account the base-case scenario with a time frame from 2010 to 2050. Results show that the life-cycle indicators implemented (climate change, ecosystem quality, and human health) evolve in accordance with the appearance of new power generation technologies. Thus, life-cycle impacts are linked to the entrance of new wind turbines from 2014 to 2035 and, from then on, to the new hydropower run-ofriver plants.},

A technology-rich, optimisation-based model for power generation in Spain is developed and provided with endogenous life-cycle indicators (climate change, resources, and human health) to assess their evolution to 2050. Prospective performance indicators are analysed under two energy scenarios: a business-as-usual one, and an alternative scenario favouring the role of carbon dioxide capture in the electricity production mix by 2050. Life-cycle impacts are found to decrease substantially when existing fossil technologies disappear in the mix (especially coal thermal power plants). In the long term, the relatively high presence of natural gas arises as the main source of impact. When the installation of new fossil options without CO2 capture is forbidden by 2030, both renewable technologies and---to a lesser extent---fossil technologies with CO2 capture are found to increase their contribution to electricity production. The endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators into energy models proves to boost the usefulness of both life cycle assessment and energy systems modelling in order to support decision- and policy-making.},

The projection of the power system has been done by using the TIMES-Spain energy model, in which two prospective scenarios have been implemented, a Business as Usual (BaU) and other with a target of 80\% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 with respect to 2005 levels. Accordingly, projections of ten LCA impact categories have been obtained. Concerning the evolution of the electricity mix, the coal power plants retirement by 2020 has been observed in both scenarios. The main differences befall on the natural gas contribution, higher in the BaU scenario than in 80\% scenario and connected to the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants usage. In addition, LCA categories selected show overall reductions in the long term reaching from 21\% in Ozone Depletion to 85\% in Acidification in the BaU scenario, and from 56\% in Ecosystems to 87\% in Acidification in the 80\% scenario. However, Abiotic Depletion potential grows up to 5-times by 2050 due to the metal requirements of the solar photovoltaic technologies, significantly present in the mix. Likewise, the analysis of the endpoint categories (Human Health and Ecosystems) concludes that their evolution is much affected by the presence of the natural gas CHPs and, furthermore, existing fossil options are the main cause of damage by far. Hence a fossil-renewable transition is needed in terms of sustainability. In summary, it is recommended to use energy systems modelling frameworks to develop comprehensive prospective LCA studies.},

  abstract = {As in many countries, coal-fired power plants in Spain account for a significant contribution to the electricity mix. Nevertheless, renewable energy options and natural gas are paving the way for coal retirement. Alternatively, it is possible to reduce the emissions (especially SO2 and NOx) associated with coal combustion through technology retrofits focused on desulphurisation and denitrification in line with the EU Industrial Emissions Directive. Within a context of low coal and CO2 prices, lifetime extension of coal-fired plants emerges as an option for power plant owners. This article prospectively evaluates the announced retrofit for 3560 MW of the Spanish coal power capacity under three alternative energy scenarios. In addition to prospective electricity production mixes, the evolution of key life-cycle sustainability indicators (climate change, human health, energy security) is assessed with time horizon 2050 using an enhanced energy systems optimisation model of power generation. When compared to the reference scenario, the results show that coal extension could favour the penetration of renewables in the long term. Notwithstanding, this would come at the expense of undesirable increases in climate change and human health impacts. Consequently, the implementation of the sustainability dimension in energy plans could avoid a ``coal conundrum'' situation in Spain.},

Beyond the integration of the sustainability concept into energy policies through the implementation of techno-economic, environmental and/or social restrictions, other approaches propose the use of externalities --based on life-cycle emissions-- to deeply take into account sustainability in the design of the future energy system. In this sense, this work evaluates the consequences of internalising socio-environmental externalities associated with power generation. Besides the calculation of external costs of power generation technologies and their implementation in an energy systems optimisation model for Spain, the life-cycle consequences of this internalisation are explored. This involves the prospective analysis of the evolution of the sustainability indicators on which the externalities are founded, i.e. climate change and human health. For the first time, this is done by endogenously integrating the life-cycle indicators into the energy systems optimisation model. The results show that the internalisation of externalities highly influences the evolution of the electricity production mix as well as the corresponding life-cycle profile, hastening the decarbonisation of the power generation system and thus leading to a significant decrease in life-cycle impacts. This effect is observed both when internalising only climate change externalities and when internalising additionally human health external costs.},

In this sense, given the acknowledged lack of future-oriented studies in this field, this article performs a prospective analysis of the energy security of a national energy system. This is done through a novel methodological framework combining Life Cycle Assessment and Energy Systems Modelling. In particular, the recently proposed Renewable Energy Security Index (RESI) is endogenously integrated into a national power generation model in order to prospectively evaluate the energy security of the Spanish electricity production mix. This facilitates the exploration of alternative energy security scenarios based on RESI targets and focused on the penetration of renewables. The results show that, despite the relatively high renewable contribution reached in a business-as-usual scenario, a significantly higher and faster renewable penetration is attained when implementing RESI targets of 70\%, 80\% and 90\% by 2030 in Spain. This is found to be associated with a large deployment of (onshore and offshore) wind power generation technology. Finally, a favourable life-cycle climate change performance is found when pursuing ambitious energy security targets.},

A fully representative LCA of the national electricity system was carried out, taking into consideration a great number of different power plant typologies for current (2016 and 2017) and future (2030) electricity mixes. The study confirms that LCA can be a powerful tool for supporting energy planning and strategies assessment. Indeed the results put in evidence not only the improvement of the environmental profile from the current to the future mix (the impacts decrease from 2016 to 2030 due to the transition towards renewables, mainly wind and photovoltaic), but also underline the difference between two scenarios at 2030 (being the scenario that includes the strategic objectives of the INECP to 2030 the one showing best environmental profile), providing an evaluation of the effect of different energy policies. For example, in the INECP scenario CO2 eq/kWh is 46\% lower than current scenario and 37\% lower than business as usual scenario for 2030. Moreover, considering different impact categories allowed to identify potential environmental trade-offs. The results suggest also the need of future insight on data related to photovoltaic technologies and materials and their future development.},

  abstract = {Climate change mitigation demands large-scale technological change on a global level and, if successfully implemented, will significantly affect how products and services are produced and consumed. In order to anticipate the life cycle environmental impacts of products under climate mitigation scenarios, we present the modeling framework of an integrated hybrid life cycle assessment model covering nine world regions. Life cycle assessment databases and multiregional input-output tables are adapted using forecasted changes in technology and resources up to 2050 under a 2 {$^\circ$}C scenario. We call the result of this modeling ``technology hybridized environmental-economic model with integrated scenarios'' (THEMIS). As a case study, we apply THEMIS in an integrated environmental assessment of concentrating solar power. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions for this plant range from 33 to 95 g CO2 eq./kWh across different world regions in 2010, falling to 30-87 g CO2 eq./kWh in 2050. Using regional life cycle data yields insightful results. More generally, these results also highlight the need for systematic life cycle frameworks that capture the actual consequences and feedback effects of large-scale policies in the long term.},

Non-climate co-benefits of low-carbon energy technologies, especially reduced mortalities from air pollution and decreased ecosystem damage, have been important arguments for policies to reduce CO2 emissions. Taking into account a wide range of environmental mechanisms and the complex interactions of the supply chains of different technologies, we conducted the first life cycle assessment of potential human health and ecological impacts of a global low-carbon electricity scenario. Our assessment indicates strong human health benefits of low-carbon electricity. For ecosystem quality, there is a significant trade-off between reduced pollution and climate impacts and potentially significant ecological impacts from land use associated with increased biopower utilization. Other renewables, nuclear power and CCS show clear ecological benefits, so that the climate mitigation scenario with a relatively low share of biopower has lower ecosystem impacts than the baseline scenario. Energy policy can maximize co-benefits by supporting other renewable and nuclear power and developing biomass supply from sources with low biodiversity impact.},

  abstract = {The targeted transition towards an electricity system with low or even negative greenhouse gas emissions affords a chance to address other environmental concerns as well, but may potentially have to adjust to the limited availability of assorted non-fossil resources. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is widely recognized as a method appropriate to assess and compare product systems taking into account a wide range of environmental impacts. Yet, LCA could not inform the latest assessment of co-benefits and trade-offs of climate change mitigation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change due to the lack of comparative assessments of different electricity generation technologies addressing a wide range of environmental impacts and using a consistent set of methods. This paper contributes to filling this gap. A consistent set of life cycle inventories of a wide range of electricity generation technologies is assessed using the Recipe midpoint methods. The life-cycle inventory modeling addresses the production and deployment of the technologies in nine different regions. The analysis shows that even though low-carbon power requires a larger amount of metals than conventional fossil power, renewable and nuclear power leads to a reduction of a wide range of environmental impacts, while CO2 capture and storage leads to increased non-GHG impacts. Biomass has relatively modest co-benefits, if at all. The manufacturing of low-carbon technologies is important compared to their operation, indicating that it is important to choose the most desirable technologies from the outset.},

  abstract = {Carbon capture technologies are regarded as promising options to mitigate CO2 emissions from large point sources, such as power generation facilities and energy intensive industries. However, CO2 capture technologies have several environmental impacts, from the system infrastructure production stage to the end of their lifetime, because of the consumption of resources in the form of materials and energy, as well as the formation of chemical by-products. All these aspects should be taken into account in order to assess and compare the real environmental sustainability of the CO2 capture processes. It is well established that life cycle assessment (LCA) represents a powerful tool to evaluate the most significant environmental impacts of CO2 capture technologies throughout their lifetimes. Using LCA methodology, this study aimed to compare life cycle emissions of membrane separation and chemical absorption processes for the post-combustion capture of one tonne of CO2 from a subcritical coal-fired power plant. Environmental impacts were evaluated considering a hybrid approach for the life cycle inventory, combining physical and economic input data. Simulation results highlighted that life cycle emissions of CO2 capture based on membrane separation process were strongly related to membrane material and thickness of the dense active layer, influencing the net power consumption and membrane area requirement. Membrane configurations investigated allowed to reduce to such an extent environmental impacts compared to CO2 capture based on monoethanoalmine (MEA) absorption. The greatest reduction potential was observed for human toxicity and impacts on freshwater and marine ecosystems, because of the elimination of environmental concerns related to solvent manufacturing and disposal of amine reclaimer wastes.},

  abstract = {Simulation-based optimization models are widely applied to find optimal operating conditions of processes. Often, computational challenges arise from model complexity, making the generation of reliable design solutions difficult. We propose an algorithm for replacing non-linear process simulation models integrated in multi-level optimization of a process and energy system superstructure with surrogate models, applying an active learning strategy to continuously enrich the database on which the surrogate models are trained and evaluated. Surrogate models are generated and trained on an initial data set, each featuring the ability to quantify the uncertainty with which a prediction is made. Until a defined prediction quality is met, new data points are continuously labeled and added to the training set. They are selected from a pool of unlabeled data points based on the predicted uncertainty, ensuring a rapid improvement of surrogate quality. When applied in the optimization superstructure, the surrogates can only be used when the prediction quality for the given data point reaches a specified threshold, otherwise the original simulation model is called for evaluating the process performance and the newly obtained data points are used to improve the surrogates. The method is tested on three simulation models, ranging in size and complexity. The proposed approach yields mean squared errors of the test prediction below 2\% for all cases. Applying the active learning approach leads to better predictions compared to random sampling for the same size of database. When integrated in the optimization framework, simpler surrogates are favored in over 60\% of cases, while the more complex ones are enabled by using simulation results generated during optimization for improving the surrogates after the initial generation. Significant time savings are recorded when using complex process simulations, though the advantage gained for simpler processes is marginal. Overall, we show that the proposed method saves time and adds flexibility to complex superstructure optimization problems that involve optimizing process operating conditions. Computational time can be greatly reduced without penalizing result quality, while the continuous improvement of surrogates when simulation is used in the optimization leads to a natural refinement of the model.},

  abstract = {Electricity generation contributes a large proportion of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United Kingdom (UK), due to the predominant use of fossil fuel (coal and natural gas) inputs. Indeed, the various power sector technologies [fossil fuel plants with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS), nuclear power stations, and renewable energy technologies (available on a large and small \{or domestic\} scale)] all involve differing environmental impacts and other risks. Three transition pathways for a more electric future out to 2050 have therefore been evaluated in terms of their lifecycle energy and environmental performance within a broader sustainability framework. An integrated approach is used here to assess the impact of such pathways, employing both energy analysis and environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA), applied on a `whole systems' basis: from `cradle-to-gate'. The present study highlights the significance of `upstream emissions', in contrast to power plant operational or `stack' emissions, and their (technological and policy) implications. Upstream environmental burdens arise from the need to expend energy resources in order to deliver, for example, fuel to a power station. They include the energy requirements for extraction, processing/refining, transport, and fabrication, as well as methane leakage that occurs in coal mining activities -- a major cotribution --and from natural gas pipelines. The impact of upstream emissions on the carbon performance of various low carbon electricity generators [such as large-scale combined heat and power (CHP) plant and CCS] and the pathways distinguish the present findings from those of other UK analysts. It suggests that CCS is likely to deliver only a 70\% reduction in carbon emissions on a whole system basis, in contrast to the normal presumption of a 90\% reduction. Similar results applied to other power generators.},

This study aims to determine whether the supply of essential minerals can keep pace with the global demand associated with the shift towards lowcarbon energy sources. In this study, critical metal minerals required by clean energy technology are taken as the research object, the supply and demand background of critical minerals are sorted and compared. By utilizing the genetic algorithm support vector regression (GA-SVR) predictive model, the research scrutinized the supply trends and developed twelve different supply and demand schemes under various development scenarios. These facilitated the assessment of the future supply sustainability of critical metals for clean energy technology. Re\- sults demonstrate that under a basic scenario, the global supply of lithium, cobalt, and nickel is projected to reach 200,000 tons, 300,000 tons, and 4 million tons, respectively, by 2030. Under a high supply scenario, these figures rise to 350,000 tons, 500,000 tons, and 5 million tons. From a global supply trend perspective, lithium, cobalt, and nickel resources are projected to grow by 2--4, 1--3, and 1.6--2 times, respectively. Examining supply and demand, the highest risk of supply shortages lies with lithium resources, followed by cobalt. Meanwhile, nickel faces no imminent risk of supply shortage. By 2030, if the compound annual growth rate of global demand for lithium and cobalt hits 15\%, supply sustainability will reach a critical juncture, leading to a supply deficit. Lithium resources may encounter this critical demand growth rate even earlier. Although the supply risks for cobalt and nickel currently appear minimal, questions around the long-term availability and sustainability of these resources persist. Ensuring the sustainable supply of these resources necessitates a well-structured and efficient system for recycling secondary resources, technological advancements in the mining industry, and improvements in material strength.},

  abstract = {Abstract               Integrated assessment models (IAMs) form a prime tool in informing about climate mitigation strategies. Diagnostic indicators that allow comparison across these models can help describe and explain differences in model projections. This increases transparency and comparability. Earlier, the IAM community has developed an approach to diagnose models (Kriegler (2015 Technol. Forecast. Soc. Change                   90 45--61)). Here we build on this, by proposing a selected set of well-defined indicators as a community standard, to systematically and routinely assess IAM behaviour, similar to metrics used for other modeling communities such as climate models. These indicators are the relative abatement index, emission reduction type index, inertia timescale, fossil fuel reduction, transformation index and cost per abatement value. We apply the approach to 17 IAMs, assessing both older as well as their latest versions, as applied in the IPCC 6th Assessment Report. The study shows that the approach can be easily applied and used to indentify key differences between models and model versions. Moreover, we demonstrate that this comparison helps to link model behavior to model characteristics and assumptions. We show that together, the set of six indicators can provide useful indication of the main traits of the model and can roughly indicate the general model behavior. The results also show that there is often a considerable spread across the models. Interestingly, the diagnostic values often change for different model versions, but there does not seem to be a distinct trend.},

While the macroeconomic models are used to deliver the economic, demographic and policy framework conditions as well as the macroeconomic impacts of particular scenarios, the bottom-up models simulate the technical developments in the final energy sectors and try to optimise electricity generation under the given boundary conditions of a particular scenario. This introductory article gives an overview of some of the energy models used in Switzerland and --- more importantly --- some insights into current advanced energy system modelling practice pointing to the characteristics of the two modelling types and their advantages and limitations.},

Our paper presents, to our knowledge, the first life-cycle assessment of the large-scale implementation of climate-mitigation technologies, addressing the feedback of the electricity system onto itself and using scenario-consistent assumptions of technical improvements in key energy and material production technologies.           ,              Decarbonization of electricity generation can support climate-change mitigation and presents an opportunity to address pollution resulting from fossil-fuel combustion. Generally, renewable technologies require higher initial investments in infrastructure than fossil-based power systems. To assess the tradeoffs of increased up-front emissions and reduced operational emissions, we present, to our knowledge, the first global, integrated life-cycle assessment (LCA) of long-term, wide-scale implementation of electricity generation from renewable sources (i.e., photovoltaic and solar thermal, wind, and hydropower) and of carbon dioxide capture and storage for fossil power generation. We compare emissions causing particulate matter exposure, freshwater ecotoxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and climate change for the climate-change-mitigation (BLUE Map) and business-as-usual (Baseline) scenarios of the International Energy Agency up to 2050. We use a vintage stock model to conduct an LCA of newly installed capacity year-by-year for each region, thus accounting for changes in the energy mix used to manufacture future power plants. Under the Baseline scenario, emissions of air and water pollutants more than double whereas the low-carbon technologies introduced in the BLUE Map scenario allow a doubling of electricity supply while stabilizing or even reducing pollution. Material requirements per unit generation for low-carbon technologies can be higher than for conventional fossil generation: 11--40 times more copper for photovoltaic systems and 6--14 times more iron for wind power plants. However, only two years of current global copper and one year of iron production will suffice to build a low-carbon energy system capable of supplying the world's electricity needs in 2050.},

  abstract = {Purpose{\enspace} In grid electricity consumption models, the location-based method uses regional average emission factors to account for environmental impacts. The market-based method is based on contractual agreements, verifying the exclusive claim on electricity from specific energy sources. An inconsistent application of these methods in life cycle assessment (LCA) and GHG accounting can lead to double counting. Especially, double counting electricity associated with rather low environmental impacts, such as renewable energy, might lead to impact underestimations. The aim of this paper is to identify, describe and propose solutions to double counting challenges. Methods{\enspace} A four-step procedure is carried out. First, the specifications on grid electricity mix selection in frequently applied standards for LCA and GHG accounting are analysed. Besides the ISO norms for LCA (14040/44) and carbon footprinting (14064/67), the GHG Protocol and the Product and Organizational Environmental Footprint (PEF/OEF) are considered. Based on this analysis, challenges of double counting electricity from specific sources are identified. In the third step, potential solutions for avoiding double counting are proposed. The last research step consists of an illustrative case study to demonstrate the calculation of market-based electricity mixes and identify potential adjustments necessities for LCA application. Results and discussion{\enspace} A parallel application of the location-based and the market-based method poses the main doublecounting challenge. Thus, avoiding double counting demands consistent method application throughout the whole life cycle. Whereas this is relatively straightforward for the location-based method, consistent market-based method application is more challenging. LCAs rely on average life cycle inventory processes, which mostly include location-based electricity mixes. However, for consistent market-based method application throughout the life cycle, electricity-related environmental impacts in the inventory system also need to be market-based. This would demand a partial recalculation of LCI datasets using market-based residual electricity mixes. Besides illustrating the calculation of market-based electricity mixes, the case study is used to identify and propose solutions for two main challenges for residual mix application in LCA: countries without residual mix and electricity under a double marketing ban. Conclusion{\enspace} Double counting of electricity from specific energy sources is a challenge, since it can lead to under- or overestimations of environmental impacts. Both the location-based and market-based method can avoid double counting. However, parallel or inconsistent applications of both methods lead to double counting. In order to avoid double counting, there is a need to enable and use consistent electricity accounting rules in LCA and GHG accounting.},

This awareness has led to the development of numerous modeling approaches with many case studies. Therefore, effort has to be made to evaluate recent modeling approaches that could be suitable for renewable energy policy evaluation. It is the aim of this paper to provide an overview on recent renewable energy policy modeling approaches that are capable in evaluating the success and side effects to other sectors of renewable energy policies. We will highlight advantages and drawbacks of these approaches and provide a framework assessing the suitability of the presented methodologies for the evaluation of renewable energy policies.

However, economy-wide decarbonisation is projected to be highly material and energy intensive. Understanding the material-energy nexus through existing research would offer valuable insights for comprehensive resource management to achieve sustainable climate mitigation. This study provides the first systematic review of material-energy nexus literature published between 2002 and 2022, emphasising the interconnections and feedback loops between material and energy systems. The global knowledge-stock is comprehensively assessed regarding research focus, sustainability challenges, and corre\- sponding circular economy strategies. Additionally, significant gaps in the research agenda and key policy im\- plications for both material consuming-developed countries and producing-developing countries are proposed. Findings of this study underscore the vital role of international cooperation in managing primary and secondary material supply chains, grounded in the ``common but differentiated responsibilities'' principle under the Paris Agreement. Consuming-developed countries should support producing-developing countries in building renewable energy capacity, optimising energy saving technologies and measures, and adhering to high envi\- ronmental standards for resources extraction and production. Meanwhile, both consuming-developed countries and producing-developing countries should take domestic mitigation measures. The former should focus on changing consumption behaviour, and the latter on increasing resource efficiency.},

  abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a method to evaluate the environmental impacts of technologies from cradle to grave. However, LCAs are commonly defined in terms of the consumption of a single unit of a product and thus ignore scaling issues in large-scale deployment of technologies. Such product-level LCAs often do not consider capital manufacturing capacity and supply chain bottlenecks that may hinder the rapid, widespread uptake of emerging technologies entering the market; emerging technologies often require the expansion of existing supply chains or the development of entirely new supply chains, such as the manufacturing of novel materials. As a result, such LCA studies are limited in their ability to realistically assess impacts at the macro-scale and thus to guide large-scale decisions. In this work, we present ECOPT2, a generalized adaptable model that combines these constraints to the LCA approach using a mathematical programming approach and dynamic stock modeling. ECOPT2 combines LCA factors with transition scenarios from energy systems models to determine the environmentally optimal deployment of new technologies while accounting for material circularity constraints and barriers to uptake. We also introduce the structure of the software tool and demonstrate its features using a stylized vehicle electrification scenario.},

The environmental costs, directly or indirectly generated to achieve such a challenging objective, remain however largely underexplored. Until now, research has focused either on pure economic approaches such as Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium (PE) models, or on (physical) energy supply scenarios. These latter could be used to evaluate the environmental impacts of various energy saving or cleaner technologies via Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. These modelling efforts have, however, been pursued in isolation, without exploring the possible complementarities and synergies. In this study, we have undertaken a practical combination of these approaches into a common framework: on the one hand, by coupling a CGE with a PE model, and, on the other hand, by linking the outcomes from the coupling with a hybrid input--output{\`A}process based life cycle inventory. The methodological framework aimed at assessing the environmental consequences of two energy policy scenarios in Luxembourg between 2010 and 2025.},

  abstract = {We analyse the future transition towards a carbon-neutral chemical sector. Our study unfolds new avenues to include SDG-based metrics in science and engineering while quantifying the potential collateral damage of CCU on sustainable development.           ,                             Carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) provides an appealing framework to turn carbon emissions into valuable fuels and chemicals. However, given the vast energy required to activate the CO               2               molecule, CCU may have implications on sustainable development that are still poorly understood due to the narrow scope of current carbon footprint-oriented assessments lacking absolute sustainability thresholds. To bridge this gap, we developed a power-chemicals nexus model to look into the future and understand how we could produce 22 net-zero bulk chemicals of crucial importance in a sustainable manner by integrating fossil, CCU routes and power technologies, often assessed separately. We evaluated the environmental performance of these technologies in terms of their contribution to 5 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), using 16 life cycle assessment metrics and 9 planetary boundaries (PB) to quantify and interpret the impact values. We found that fossil chemicals could hamper the attainment of SDG 3 on good health and well-being and SDG 13 on climate change. CCU could help meet SDG 13 but would damage other SDGs due to burden-shifting to human health, water scarcity, and minerals and metals depletion impacts. The collateral damage could be mitigated by judiciously combining fossil and CCU routes with carbon-negative power sources guided by optimisation models incorporating SDGs-based performance criteria explicitly. Our work highlights the importance of embracing the SDGs in technology development to sensibly support the low-carbon energy and chemicals transition.},

Furthermore, decisions on energy policies and plans should be based on the analysis of a number of potential energy scenarios, considering the evolution of key techno-economic and life-cycle sustainability indicators. The joint interpretation of these multiple criteria should drive the choice of appropriate decisions for energy planning. Within this context, this work proposes efor the first timee the combined use of Life Cycle Assessment, externalities calculation, Energy Systems Modelling and dynamic Data Envelopment Analysis to prioritise prospective energy scenarios. For demonstration and illustrative purposes, the application of this methodological framework to the case study of electricity production in Spain leads to quantitatively discriminate between 15 prospective energy scenarios by taking into account the life-cycle profile of the transformation path of the power generation system with time horizon 2050. When compared to the application of the framework without implementation of external costs, the internalisation of climate change externalities is found to affect the ranking of energy scenarios but still showing the rejection of those scenarios based on the lifetime extension of coal power plants, as well as the preference for those scenarios leading to a high penetration of renewable technologies.},

This paper describes the changes made and planned to SALib to advance the ease with which modelers may conduct sensitivity analysis and interpret results. We further offer our perspectives from the past 7 years of maintaining SALib for the consideration of those aspiring to launch their own software for sensitivity analysis, develop methodology, or those otherwise interested in becoming involved in a project like SALib. These include the value of a community of practice to foster best practices for sensitivity analysis, the potential for collaboration across different software (for sensitivity analysis) platforms, and the need to specifically support the software development that underpins computational science.},

  abstract = {Energy, water, and the environment are intricately connected, and these relationships necessitate their simultaneous management to achieve sustainable development. In this study, a stochastic multidivisional hierarchy model (SMHM) is developed for use in planning an energy-water-environment nexus system (EWES). The SMHM is not only capable of addressing uncertainties expressed as interval and stochastic parameters within multidivisional and multi-level contexts, but also those accounting for the synergy and trade-off relationships between different stakeholders. Decisions are made through the SMHM in two stages: top management given the first choice followed by the concurrent responses of the divisions. SMHM is applied to a real-world case study of EWES in Shanxi, China. Results reveal that energy-intensive industry (i.e., electricity generation) consumes more water and emits more pollutants than others. In addition, uncertainties have significant effects on the planning strategies of EWES; compared with a high-risk scenario of electricity insufficiency, a low-risk scenario would consume additional amounts of [3.3, 5.7] {\^A} 109 tce energy and [1.8, 2.6] {\^A} 106 m3 water. Compared with singlelevel models, the SMHM schemes enable both resource savings and environmental sustainability. These findings could assist stakeholders in resolving conflicts and provide useful information for the integrated management of regional energy, water, and the environment.},

  abstract = {It has been established in several studies that the current environmental impact of humanity exceeds the carrying capacity of terrestrial systems, be it in terms of biodiversity loss or climate change impacts. A major source of impact is power generation, which faces the challenge of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions without shifting the burden to other environmental impacts. Exergy-based environmental indicators have proven to be effective to some extent in assessing the environmental impacts in the current energy mix but the robustness of this use as environmental proxies has barely been assessed in energy transition scenario. Hence, the objective of this study is to analyse their relevance in the context of the energy transition for power generation. To this end, we investigate the potential relationships between different energy indicators and environmental indicators using life cycle assessment, with French electricity generation as a case study. In the context of a transformation of the electricity system, this allows an assessment of the expected discrepancies between the energy change and the environmental impact. The results show that no general correlation can be found between the 16 studied environmental impacts and the energy indicators when shifting from one source of energy to another, even if some trends are observed for some impact categories. In consequence, a comprehensive analysis of the environmental impacts of electricity generation in the context of the energy transition cannot be based on a single or a selection of indicators alone, but requires a comprehensive assessment based on a multi-criteria approach. This holistic approach is the only way to uncover potential trade-offs occurring between energy, exergy and environmental indicators, when optimizing a specific indicator.},

However, these models usually do not consider sustainability aspects such as environmental impacts. In contrast, life cycle assessment enables an extensive estimate of those impacts. Due to these complementary characteristics, the combination of energy system models and life cycle assessment thus allows comprehensive environmental sustainability assessments of technically and economically feasible energy system transformation pathways. We introduce FRITS, a FRamework for the assessment of environmental Impacts of Transformation Scenarios. FRITS links bottom-up energy system models with life cycle impact assessment indicators and quantifies the environmental impacts of transformation strategies of the entire energy system (power, heat, transport) over the transition period. We apply the framework to conduct an environmental assessment of multi-sectoral energy scenarios for Germany. Here, a `Target' scenario reaching 80\% reduction of energy-related direct CO2 emissions is compared with a `Reference' scenario describing a less ambitious transformation pathway. The results show that compared to 2015 and the `Reference' scenario, the `Target' scenario performs better for most life cycle impact assessment indicators. However, the impacts of resource consumption and land use increase for the `Target' scenario. These impacts are mainly caused by road passenger transport and biomass conversion.},

Moreover, we include the uncertainties regarding the specific material content of these subtechnologies and the reserve and resource estimates. Furthermore, the development of the material demand in non-energy sectors is considered. The results show that the material requirements increase with the degree of ambition of the scenarios. The maximum annual primary material demand of the scenarios exceeds current extraction volumes by a factor of 3 to 9 (Nd), 7 to 35 (Dy), 12 to 143 (Li), and 2 to 22 (Co). The ratios of cumulative primary material demand to average reserve estimates range from 0.1 to 0.3 (Nd), 0.3 to 1.1 (Dy), 0.7 to 6.5 (Li), and 0.8 to 5.5 (Co). Average resource estimates of Li and Co are exceeded by up to a factor of 2.1 and 1.7, respectively.

  abstract = {Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases of humans caused by pathogens that are shared between humans and other vertebrate animals. Previously, pristine natural areas with high biodiversity were seen as likely sources of new zoonotic pathogens, suggesting that biodiversity could have negative impacts on human health. At the same time, biodiversity has been recognized as potentially benefiting human health by reducing the transmission of some pathogens that have already established themselves in human populations. These apparently opposing effects of biodiversity in human health may now be reconcilable. Recent research demonstrates that some taxa are much more likely to be zoonotic hosts than others are, and that these animals often proliferate in human-dominated landscapes, increasing the likelihood of spillover. In less-disturbed areas, however, these zoonotic reservoir hosts are less abundant and nonreservoirs predominate. Thus, biodiversity loss appears to increase the risk of human exposure to both new and established zoonotic pathogens. This new synthesis of the effects of biodiversity on zoonotic diseases presents an opportunity to articulate the next generation of research questions that can inform management and policy. Future studies should focus on collecting and analyzing data on the diversity, abundance, and capacity to transmit of the taxa that actually share zoonotic pathogens with us. To predict and prevent future epidemics, researchers should also focus on how these metrics change in response to human impacts on the environment, and how human behaviors can mitigate these effects. Restoration of biodiversity is an important frontier in the management of zoonotic disease risk.},

Comprehensive energy demand modelling is often made with a simplified approach or based on assumptions scattered among various sources, if it is published at all. There is no detailed discussion of the impact of various macro-economic scenarios on different levels of energy demand available. This study uses LUT-DEMAND, a novel modelling tool for energy demand, to create comprehensive demand input data in high spatial resolution globally and high temporal resolution until 2100. A multi-step approach is applied to estimate the energy demand. A variety of economic and demographic scenarios are explored, including the shared socio-economic pathways. The total primary energy demand is estimated for possible limitations caused by the overall energy demand and chosen technol\- ogies. The results for this century's energy supply for ambitious transition targets are presented, and they show a significant impact of macro-economic assumptions on scale and trajectory on all levels of energy demand. Among the explored scenarios, the total primary energy demand may rise to 399 PWh (1435 EJ) by 2100, with a maximum estimated solar photovoltaic capacity demand of about 200 TWp. LUT-DEMAND and its documen\- tation are available in an open-access online repository.},

This paper examines public sentiment toward solar energy in the United States using data from Twitter, a micro-blogging platform on which people post messages, known as tweets. We filtered tweets specific to solar energy and performed a classification task using Robustly optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (RoBERTa). Our RoBERTa-based sentiment classification model, fine-tuned with 6300 manually annotated tweets specific to solar energy, attains 80.2\% accuracy for ternary (positive, neutral, or negative) classification. Analyzing 266,686 tweets during the period of January to December 2020, we find public sentiment varies widely across states (Coefficient of Variation =164.66\%). Within the study period, the Northeast U.S. region shows more positive sentiment toward solar energy than did the South U.S. region. Public opinion on solar energy is more positive in states with a larger share of Democratic voters in the 2020 presidential election. Public sentiment toward solar energy is more positive in states with consumer-friendly net metering policies and a more mature solar market. States that wish to gain public support for solar energy might want to consider implementing consumer-friendly net metering policies and support the growth of solar businesses.},

This study examines the problem of resource constraints in the development of clean energy and transportation technologies (namely wind turbines and batteries in electric vehicles) for different global energy-consumption scenarios. For this study, lithium and cobalt (demand from electric vehicles) and neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium (cumulative demand from electric vehicles and wind power) were considered as critical materials. The application of simple dynamic models allows for an integrated assessment, taking into account changes in energy demand, resource intensity of wind energy and electric ve\- hicles, and exploration and recycling technologies. The obtained results show that, irrespective of the considered scenario or the method used for estimating rare-earth element reserves, the demand for neodymium and pra\- seodymium remains within a maximum of 12\%--14\% of the total reserves even when the development in recycling technologies is not considered. Meanwhile, the demand for dysprosium is much more significant at 86\% in the absence of recycling technologies. There are strong indicators that clean-energy development can be threatened by the shortage of cobalt and lithium by the middle of this century unless we achieve rapid progress in technologies related to their exploration and reuse.},

  abstract = {As nations face the need to decarbonise their energy supply, there is a risk that attention will be focused solely on carbon and climate change, potentially at the expense of other environmental impacts. To explore the trade-offs between climate change mitigation and other environmental impacts, this work focuses on electricity and considers a number of scenarios up to 2070 in a UK context with different carbon reduction targets and electricity demand to estimate the related life cycle environmental impacts. In total, 16 scenarios are discussed, incorporating fossilfuel technologies with and without carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and a range of renewable options. A freely available model -- Electricity Technologies Life Cycle Assessment (ETLCA) -- developed by the authors has been used for these purposes. The results suggest that decarbonisation of electricity supply to meet carbon targets would lead to a reduction in the majority of the life cycle impacts by 2070. The exceptions to this are depletion of elements which would increase by 4--145 times and health impacts from radiation which would increase two- to four-fold if nuclear power were used. Ozone layer depletion would also go up in the short-term by between 2.5--3.7 times. If energy demand continued to grow, three other impacts would also increase while trying to meet the carbon targets: human toxicity (two times), photochemical smog (12\%) and terrestrial eco-toxicity (2.3 times). These findings demonstrate the importance of considering a broader range of environmental impacts alongside climate change to avoid decarbonising the economy at the expense of other environmental impacts.},

  abstract = {Summary             Industrial ecology (IE) and life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) are increasingly important in research, regulation, and corporate practice. However, the assessment of the social pillar is still at a developmental stage, because social life cycle assessment (SLCA) is fragmented and lacks a foundation on empirical experience. A critical reason is the absence of general standardized indicators that clearly reflect and measure businesses' social impact along product life cycles and supply chains. Therefore, we systematically review trends, coherences, inconsistencies, and gaps in research on SLCA indicators across industry sectors. Overall, we find that researchers address a broad variety of sectors, but only few sectors receive sufficient empirical attention to draw reasonable conclusions while the field is additionally still largely an a-theoretical one. Furthermore, researchers overlook important social core issues as they concentrate heavily on worker- and health-related indicators. Therefore, we synthetize the most important indicators used in research as a step toward standardization (including critical challenges in applying these indicators and recommendations for their future development), highlight important trends and gaps (e.g., the focus on worker- and health-related indicators and the a-theoretical nature of the SLCA literature), and emphasize critical shortcomings in the SLCA field organized along the key phases of design, implementation, and evolution through which performance measurement approaches such as SLCA typically progress in their development and maturation. With this, we contribute to the maturation and establishment of the social pillar of LCSA and IE.},

  abstract = {Carbon-neutral hydrogen (H2) can reduce emissions from hard-to-electrify sectors and contribute to a net-zero greenhouse gas economy by 2050. Power-to-hydrogen (PtH2) technologies based on clean electricity can provide such H2, yet their carbon intensities alone do not provide sufficient basis to judge their potential contribution to a sustainable and just energy transition. Introducing a prospective life cycle assessment framework to decipher the non-linear relationships between future technology and energy system dynamics over time, we showcase its relevance to inform research, development, demonstration, and deployment by comparing two PtH2 technologies to steam methane reforming (SMR) across a series of environmental and resourceuse metrics. We find that the system transitions in the power, cement, steel, and fuel sectors move impacts for both PtH2 technologies to equal or lower levels by 2100 compared to 2020 per kg of H2 except for metal depletion. The decarbonization of the United States power sector by 2035 allows PtH2 to reach parity with SMR at 10 kg of CO2e/kg H2 between 2030 and 2050. Updated H2 radiative forcing and leakage levels only marginally affect these results. Biomass carbon removal and storage power technologies enable carbon-negative H2 after 2040 at about -15 kg of CO2e/kg H2. Still, both PtH2 processes exhibit higher impacts across most other metrics, some of which are worsened by the decarbonization of the power sector. Observed increases in metal depletion and eco- and human toxicity levels can be reduced via PtH2 energy and material use efficiency improvements, but the power sector decarbonization routes also warrant further review and cradle-to-grave assessments to show tradeoffs from a systems perspective.},

  abstract = {Energy is engaged in the supply chain of many economic sectors; therefore, the environmental impacts of the energy sector are indirectly linked to those of other sectors. Consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) is an appropriate methodology to examine the direct and indirect environmental impacts of a product due to technological, economic or social changes. To date, different methodological approaches are proposed, combining economic and environmental models. This paper reviews the basic concept of CLCA and the coupling of economic and environmental models for performing CLCA in the energy sector during the period 2006--2020, with the aim to provide a description of the different tools, highlighting their strengths and limitations. From the review, it emerges that economic modelling tools are frequently used in combination with environmental data for CLCA in the energy sector, including equilibrium, input-output, and dynamic models. Out of these, the equilibrium model is the most widely used, showing some strengths in availability of data and energy system modelling tools. The input-output model allows for describing both direct and indirect effects due to changes in the energy sector, by using publicly available data. The dynamic model is less frequently applied due to its limitation in availability of data and modelling tools, but has recently attracted more attention due to the ability in modelling quantitative and qualitative indicators of sustainability.},

Estimating the cost evolution in the future is hence essential in long-term energy planning. Despite a number of existing studies, the estimated costs show strong hetero- geneity. Additionally, emerging technologies, such as electrolysis and CCUS (carbon capture, utilisation and storage), have gained limited attention. To improve the plausibility of the cost projection, we analysed the rela- tionship between accumulated installation and the corresponding CAPEX for 14 low-carbon technologies, and applied 5-8 learning curves (LRs) via Non-Linear Optimization (NLP) for projecting the cost evolutions towards 2050. The LRs were carefully selected based upon the index of Coefficient of Determination, and calibrated by comparison to a bunch of existing literature. Based upon our results: (1) residential PV and onshore wind rank the highest and lowest respectively in terms of the decreasing potential; (2) the majority of energy technologies are promising to achieve 36\% - 74\% cost reduction in 2050 compared to 2020, with a mean value around 50\%. This study can be helpful as benchmark for energy stakeholders in decision-making towards carbon neutrality.}

  abstract = {Empirical evidence increasingly indicates that to achieve sufficiently rapid decarbonisation, high-income economies may need to adopt degrowth policies, scaling down less-necessary forms of production and demand, in addition to rapid deployment of renewables. Calls have been made for degrowth climate mitigation scenarios. However, so far these have not been modelled within the established Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) for future scenario analysis of the energy-economy-emission nexus, partly because the architecture of these IAMs has growth `baked in'. In this work, we modify one of the common IAMs -- MESSAGEix -- to make it compatible with degrowth scenarios. We simulate scenarios featuring low and negative growth in a high-income economy (Australia). We achieve this by detaching MESSAGEix from its monotonically growing utility function, and by formulating an alternative utility function based on non-monotonic preferences. The outcomes from such modified scenarios reflect some characteristics of degrowth futures, including reduced aggregate production and declining energy and emissions. However, further work is needed to explore other key degrowth features such as sectoral differentiation, redistribution, and provisioning system transformation.},

The evolution of network states' probability density functions (PDFs) in terms of GET penetration levels are characterized by the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). The FPE is numerically solved to compute the PDFs of network states, and a calibration process is also proposed such that the accuracy of the REM is maintained for large-scale distribution networks. The approach is illustrated on a large-scale realistic distribution network using a modified version of the IEEE 8500 feeder, where electric vehicles (EVs) or photovoltaic systems (PVs) are installed at various penetration rates. It is demonstrated from quantitative analyses that the results from our proposed approach have negligible errors comparing with those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is at present widely used in the design and planning of sustainable systems where economic, environmental and social aspects must be considered simultaneously. The solution of a multi-objective model is given by a set of Pareto optimal points that feature the property that they cannot be improved in one objective without necessarily worsening at least another one. Identifying the best Pareto solution from this set is challenging, particularly when many objectives and decision-makers are involved in the analysis. In this work, we propose the first rigorous method (to the authors' knowledge) based on bilevel optimization to explore Pareto points that allows to: (i) identify in a systematic manner non-dominated solutions which are particularly appealing for decision-makers; (ii) quantify the distance between any (suboptimal) feasible point of a MOO model and its Pareto front (i.e. project suboptimal points onto the Pareto frontier); and (iii) establish improvement targets for suboptimal solutions of a MOO (through projection onto the Pareto front) that if attained would make them optimal. Overall, our method allows analysing Pareto fronts and selecting a final Pareto point to be implemented in practice without the need to define subjective weights in an explicit manner. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach through its application to the optimization of the UK electricity mix according to several economic, environmental and social indicators.},

  abstract = {Humanity is at the beginning of its third energy revolution, after coal and then oil, we are now moving towards the massive use of renewable energies that we knew since the dawn of time. This change will solve several problems, including climate change, as the concentration of greenhouse gases will stabilise. The success of fossil fuels resides in their storability. Indeed, these energies have been stored in the earth for millions of years and can be extracted whenever humans need energy. Their costs of storage are insignificant compared to their costs of extraction. On the contrary, the main renewable energies are intermittent, i.e. wind and solar energy, and thus cannot be stored. However, these energy can be converted into electricity, heat or another form of energy that can be stored. But storing these energy carriers has a significant cost and thus, redefine the design of the energy system. Hence, the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energies - mainly intermittent - requires a complete rethinking of the energy systemsupply chain from resources to demand while including conversion and storage technologies. In particular, to understand what will be the role of storage technologies in this energy system throughout the energy transition period and after. To address this issue, the thesis addresses the following research question: What is the role of energy storage technologies for the energy transition? Focusing on the role of storage requires the inclusion of its environment, i.e. the energy system. Focusing on the energy transition requires a time horizon fromtoday...},

Along with the climate goals of the Paris Agreement, the national greenhouse gas strategies of industrialized countries involve the total restructuring of their energy systems. In order to archive these climate goals, fitted and customized models are required. For that reason, this paper focuses on national energy system models that incorporate all energy sectors and can support governmental decision making processes. The reviewed models are evaluated in terms of their characteristics, like their underlying methodology, analytical approach, time horizon and transformation path analysis, spatial and temporal resolution, licensing and modeling language. These attributes are set in the context of the region and time in which they were developed in order to identify trends in modeling. Furthermore, the revealed trends are set in the context of current challenges in energy systems modeling. Combining specified research questions and specific greenhouse gas reduction strategies, this paper will help researchers and decision makers find appropriate energy system models.},

This study assessed the influence of environmental impact indicators on prioritisation of `dispatchable' technologies in the European energy mix up to 2050, compared with a purely cost-optimal system based on carbon tax incentives, without suppressing economic growth considerations. A model that combined the Prospective Outlook for Long-term Energy Systems model (POLES) and the European and Transmission Grid Investment and Dispatch model (EUTGRID)was used in the analysis. Combined current and prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies were added to the EUTGRID model to include environmental considerations in the decision-making process. Shifting from an economic to an environmental merit order in prioritisation increased the share of renewables by 2.65\% (with variations between countries) and decreased overall emissions by 9.00\%. This involved a change in grid infrastructure. Investments were found to be more important when optimisation was based on an environmental criterion on new high-voltage AC power lines, which resulted in a 1.50\% increase in the overall cost of the power system. Finally, considering an environmental, instead of an economic, merit order allowed decarbonisation to be achieved slightly faster, resulting in lower cumulative greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere.},

Those two contradictory indicators are incorporated in a multi-criteria optimisation leading to iterations of two scenario: business as usual and 2  C climate policy. The results present the evolution of the climate change emission versus the operational costs of the power system up to 2050. The yearly electricity mix evaluations allow assessing the long-term development of the European energy system, where a focus is done on variable renewable energy production. It is shown that policy-only solutions, associated with a traditional cost-oriented optimisation, have a limited impact on helping the power sector to reach emission levels targets. Integrating the objective of reducing emissions to the management of power plants would reduce the absolute and cumulative carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The counterpart is that the system electricity price tends to increase faster thus implying increased social costs.},

Beyond greenhouse gas emissions, the power sector is also responsible for numerous other environmental impacts. Here we combine scenarios from integrated assessment models with a~forward-looking life-cycle assessment to explore how alternative technology choices in power sector decarbonization pathways compare in terms of non-climate environmental impacts at the system level. While all decarbonization pathways yield major environmental co-benefits, we find that the scale of co-benefits as well as profiles of adverse side-effects depend strongly on technology choice. Mitigation scenarios focusing on wind and solar power are more effective in reducing human health impacts compared to those with low renewable energy, while inducing a more pronounced shift away from fossil and toward mineral resource depletion. Conversely, non-climate ecosystem damages are highly uncertain but tend to increase, chiefly due to land requirements for bioenergy.},

According to the methodology, environmental characteristics can be examined by identifying affected activities, i.e. often the marginal technology. The present `state-of theart' method is to identify the long-term change in power plant capacity, known as the long-term marginal technology, and assume that the marginal supply will be fully produced at such capacity. However, the marginal change in capacity will have to operate as an integrated part of the total energy system. Consequently, it does not necessarily represent the marginal change in electricity supply, which is likely to involve a mixture of different production technologies. Especially when planning future sustainable energy systems involving combined heat and power (CHP) and fluctuating renewable energy sources, such issue becomes very important.},

This approach has been validated with historical data and was adapted in this study to identify the marginal suppliers in a pro\- spective context. The different steps within the approach were analyzed, and alternative techniques for each step within the heuristic method were proposed. The techniques were tested on the future electricity sector using projections from two integrated assessment models (IMAGE and REMIND). Results show the sensitivity of results on the modelling technique selected in each step. The most sensitive step is the selection of the time interval, with even small changes resulting in a noticeable difference. In addition, the results also showed a substantial difference between the projections of the two models. The relevance and goals of the alternative techniques for each step were discussed to guide users in forming the heuristic method for their study.},

This article addresses the combination of life-cycle (LC) approaches and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for the sustainability assessment of energy systems. Through a literature survey of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tools for sustainability assessment of energy systems, the most commonly used criteria, data sources and tools are identified. Moreover, a review of the LC {\th} DEA approaches available to date is performed in order to check their convenience to assess energy systems in terms of sustainability. In this sense, the central focus of the article is to explore and elucidate potentials of these combined approaches within sustainability-oriented MCDA in the field of energy. These potentials are mainly associated with the usefulness of sustainability benchmarks for decision-makers and the wide availability of DEA models and life-cycle approaches. Given the growing role of MCDA tools in energy scenario analysis and the innovative trends found in LC {\th} DEA, a novel methodological framework is proposed: enriched energy systems modelling through (i) endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators and (ii) ranking and benchmarking of energy scenarios according to sustainability criteria using dynamic DEA. The LC {\th} DEA concept emerges as a promising methodology to evaluate and rank prospective scenarios in energy planning, thus facilitating decision-making processes towards a sustainable energy future.},

In the case of the Spanish electricity sector, regulations applicable to existing coal thermal plants and the proximity to the end of the lifetime of nuclear power plants arise as critical concerns to be addressed. In this respect, a sensible energy strategy is required in order to fill the future gap of coal and nuclear power plants. Within this context, this work applies a novel methodological framework for the prioritisation of 15 energy scenarios formulated for power generation in Spain. In addition to a business-as-usual scenario, alternative ones are built based on potential restrictions on fossil-based technologies and lifetime extensions of coal and nuclear power plants. The novel multi-criteria decision analysis approach for enhanced, sustainabilityoriented energy planning is based on the combined use of energy systems modelling, life cycle assessment, and data envelopment analysis. Besides conventional techno-economic results, the evolution of life-cycle indicators endogenously integrated into the energy system model of Spain is provided. The subsequent use of a dynamic data envelopment analysis model leads to identify and rank the most suitable energy scenarios according to sustainability criteria.},

  abstract = {Transitioning to more sustainable energy technologies is a vital step in the move toward reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. However, several physical constraints could hinder the implementation of these technologies, and many of the raw materials required to produce new infrastructure are scarce, nonrenewable, and nonsubstitutable. Various factors relating to material extraction and processing activities may also affect the security and sociopolitical aspects of future supply lines. Here, we introduce methods for quantifying three key indicators relating to raw material supplies for specific production processes: (1) overall supply risk, (2) environmental impacts from sourcing raw materials, and (3) environmental justice threats at sourcing locations. The use of the proposed methods is demonstrated via an exploratory case study examining projected electricity production scenarios within the European Union. Results suggest that renewable sources of electricity{\dbend}particularly wind, solar, and geothermal technologies{\dbend}are more likely to exacerbate supply risks and environmental issues than other technologies. Furthermore, projected expansions of wind and solar technologies mean that all three indicators appear likely to rise significantly systemwide by 2050. Ultimately, the methods represent a much-needed first attempt at providing practitioners with simple and robust approaches for integrating factors relating specifically to raw material supply into energy modeling and other applications.},

  abstract = {Many of the long-term policy decisions surrounding the sustainable energy transition rely on models that fail to consider environmental impacts and constraints beyond direct greenhouse gas emissions and land occupation. Such assessments offer incomplete and potentially misleading information about the true sustainability issues of transition pathways. Meanwhile, although decision-makers desire greater access to a broader range of envi\- ronmental, material and socio-economic indicators, few tools currently address this gap. Here, we introduce ENBIOS, a framework that integrates a broader range of such indicators into energy modelling and policymaking practices. By calculating sustainability-related indicators across hierarchical levels, we reach deeper un\- derstandings of the potential energy systems to be derived. With ENBIOS, we analyse a series of energy pathways designed by the Calliope energy system optimization model for the European energy system in 2030 and 2050. Although overall emissions will drop significantly, considerable rises in land, labour and critical raw material requirements are likely. These outcomes are further reflected in unfavourable shifts in key metabolic indicators during this period; energy metabolic rate of the system will drop by 25.6\%, land requirement-to-energy will quadruple, while the critical raw material supply risk-to-energy ratio will rise by 74.2\%. Heat from biomass and electricity from wind and solar are shown to be the dominant future processes across most indicator categories.},

  abstract = {The transition towards low-emission energy generation, storage and transport will require metal production beyond the already historically high production levels the minerals industry is achieving. This is problematic for several reasons, one being the fact that a majority of the metals required for these technologies are considered critical and are currently supplied as low volume byproducts of other main commodities, such as Cu or Zn. The low volume and specialist nature of these byproduct metals means that economic drivers to optimize their re\- covery are absent, causing these important resources to be lost to mine waste. Thin-film cadmium-telluride (CdTe) photovoltaics continue to be an emerging energy technology alternative to Si-based solar panels. How\- ever, the Cd and Te used to manufacture these panels are almost exclusively sourced as byproducts of either Zn or Cu. This study presents new Te supply and demand scenarios for CdTe photovoltaics based on a new Te material intensity value of 15.2 Mg/GW, outlining potential variations in demand as a result of the energy transition. We also examine how market demand and downstream low-emissions energy generation can be used to drive improved byproduct critical metal recovery from the Cu sector. This improved recovery of byproduct critical metals could ultimately lead toward the more responsible use of finite non-renewable resources as well as providing increased amounts of the raw materials for the power generation infrastructure required by the energy transition.},

We stress the limited insights from considering territorial GHG emissions only. Indeed, significant GHG emissions persist outside of Switzerland by 2050 ({\textasciitilde}3-5 Mtons CO             2             -eq./year) because of imports and energy related infrastructure, even though domestic emissions are reduced to net zero. Global climate policies influence the extra-territorial GHG emissions Switzerland is responsible for. Additionally, we must broaden the spectrum of environmental indicators in the context of many countries' ambitions to achieve net zero goals. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved, showing how environmental impacts other than those on climate change (ecosystem impacts, air pollution, natural resource use) could increase and shift from Switzerland to the rest of the world as the country electrifies its economy.},

This study proposes a novel approach that systematically changes the background processes in a prospective LCA based on scenarios of an integrated assessment model (IAM), the IMAGE model. Consistent worldwide scenarios from IMAGE are evaluated in the life cycle inventory using ecoinvent v3.3. To test the approach, only the electricity sector was changed in a prospective LCA of an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and an electric vehicle (EV) using six baseline and mitigation climate scenarios until 2050. This case study shows that changes in the electricity background can be very important for the environmental impacts of EV. Also, the approach demonstrates that the relative environmental performance of EV and ICEV over time is more complex and multifaceted than previously assumed. Uncertainty due to future developments manifests in different impacts depending on the product (EV or ICEV), the impact category, and the scenario and year considered. More robust prospective LCAs can be achieved, particularly for emerging technologies, by expanding this approach to other economic sectors beyond electricity background changes and mobility applications as well as by including uncertainty and changes in foreground parameters. A more systematic and structured composition of future inventory databases driven by IAM scenarios helps to acknowledge epistemological uncertainty and to increase the temporal consistency of foreground and background systems in LCAs of emerging technologies.},

  abstract = {In the booming research on the environmental footprint of, for example, electrical vehicles, heat pumps and other (smart) electricity consuming appliances, there is a clear need to know the hourly CO2 content of one kW h of electricity. Since the CO2 footprint of electricity can vary every hour; the footprint of for example an electric vehicle is influenced by the time when the vehicle is charged. With the availability of the hourly CO2 content of one kW h, a decision support tool is provided to fully exploit the advantages of a future smart grid. In this paper, the GWP (Global Warming Potential) per kW h for each hour of the year is calculated for Belgium using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. This enables evaluating the influence of the electricity demand on the greenhouse gas emissions. Because of the LCA approach, the CO2 equivalent content does not only reflect activities related to the production of the electricity within a power plant, but includes carbon emissions related to the building of the infrastructure and the fuel supply chain. The considered feedstocks are nuclear combustible, oil, coal, natural gas, biowaste, blast furnace gas, and wood. Furthermore, renewable electricity production technologies like photovoltaic cells, hydro installations and wind turbines are covered by the research. The production of the wind turbines and solar panels is more carbon intensive (expressed per generated kW h of electricity) than the production of other conventional power plants, due to the lower electricity output. The overall average GWP per kW h is 0.184 kg CO2eq/kW h. Throughout the 2011 this value ranges from a minimum of 0.102 kg CO2eq/kW h to a maximum of 0.262 kg CO2eq/kW h depending on the timing.},

In this context, the purpose of this study is to evaluate and highlight the interest of CO2 conversion into methanol through a complete techno-economic and environmental assessment of the entire process chain. The integrated process, successfully implemented in Aspen Plus{\textregistered}, is designed to treat the CO2 coming from a conventional cement plant. A MEA-based CO2 capture process is considered, and the captured CO2 is then directly sent to the conversion unit for its catalytic conversion. Consequently, combining the two units leads to relevant integrations, especially regarding the reuse of the heat provided by the exothermal methanol reactions for the regeneration of the CO2 capture solvent. An economic assessment is proposed to estimate the operational and investment costs, as well as the net present value, which demonstrates that the economic feasibility strongly depends on electricity and H2 production costs. A Life Cycle Analysis method is finally performed to identify the main environmental hotspots. The underlying process design offers a significant reduction in greenhouse gases (besides other categories) when compared to the conventional fossil production from natural gas.},

This paper presents a novel robust risk assessment method under demand uncertainty for energy planning scenarios for the islands. The method uses graph theory for the representation of power system topology. The Poisson distribution is used for calculating the probability of power system element failure. The robust modelling approach is applied by the introduction of auxiliary variables and compared to the deterministic model results. Four energy planning scenarios for Unije island are modelled and subjugated to several power system outages resulting in a risk vector calculated as the product of probability vector and damage matrix. The study also presents a zero-import risk energy planning scenario for Unije island that is achieved for a system of 0.5 MW photovoltaic plant and 3.55 MWh battery storage system.},

  abstract = {In recent literature, prospective application of life cycle assessment (LCA) at low technology readiness levels (TRL) has gained immense interest for its potential to enable development of emerging technologies with improved environmental performances. However, limited data, uncertain functionality, scale up issues and uncertainties make it very challenging for the standard LCA guidelines to evaluate emerging technologies and requires methodological advances in the current LCA framework. In this paper, we review published literature to identify major methodological challenges and key research efforts to resolve these issues with a focus on recent developments in five major areas: cross-study comparability, data availability and quality, scale-up issues, uncertainty and uncertainty communication, and assessment time. We also provide a number of recommendations for future research to support the evaluation of emerging technologies at low technology readiness levels: (a) the development of a consistent framework and reporting methods for LCA of emerging technologies; (b) the integration of other tools with LCA, such as multicriteria decision analysis, risk analysis, technoeconomic analysis; and (c) the development of a data repository for emerging materials, processes, and technologies.},

  abstract = {The transition from a fossil fuel base to a renewable energy system relies on materials and, in particular, metals to manufacture and maintain energy conversion technologies. Supply constraints shift from fossil fuels to mineral resources. We assess the availability of metal reserves and resources to build an energy system based exclusively on renewable energy technologies. A mass balance of 29 metals embodied in renewable energy technologies is compiled in order to satisfy global energy demand, based on five authoritative energy scenarios for 2050. We expand upon these scenarios by modeling the storage capacity needed to support high shares of intermittent renewables (wind and solar). The metal requirements are then compared with the current demand and proven reserves and ultimate mineable resources. This allows us to distinguish between constraints related to renewable energy sources from those linked to technology mixes. The results show that proven reserves and, in specific cases, resources of several metals are insufficient to build a renewable energy system at the predicted level of global energy demand by 2050. The comparison between reserves and resources shows that scarcity relates sometimes more to techno economic supply than to raw material availability. Our results also highlight the importance of substitution among technologies and metals as well as the limited impact of recycling on the depletion of scarce metals.},

  abstract = {In the development of climate-friendly energy system transformation strategies it is often ignored that environmental protection encompasses more than climate protection alone. There is therefore a risk of developing transformation strategies whose climate friendliness comes at the expense of higher other environmental impacts. Consequently, an assessment of environmental impacts of energy system transformation strategies is required if undesired environmental side effects of the energy system transformation are to be avoided and transformation strategies are to be developed that are both climate and environmentally friendly. In this paper, ten structurally different transformation strategies for the German energy system were re-modeled (in a harmonized manner). Five of these scenarios describe pathways for a reduction of direct, energy related CO2 emissions by 80\%, the other five by 95\%. Life cycle-based environmental impacts of the scenarios were assessed by coupling the scenario results with data from a life cycle inventory database focusing on energy and transport technologies. The results show that the transformation to a climate-friendly energy system reduces environmental impacts in many impact categories. However, exceptions occur with respect to the consumption of mineral resources, land use and certain human health indicators, which could increase with decreasing CO2 emissions. The comparison of environmental impacts of moderately ambitious strategies (80\% CO2 reduction) with very ambitious strategies (95\% CO2 reduction) shows that there is a risk of increasing environmental impacts with increasing climate protection, although very ambitious strategies do not necessarily come along with higher environmental impacts than moderately ambitious strategies. A reduction of environmental impacts could be achieved by a moderate and -- as far as possible --direct electrification of heat and transport, a balanced technology mix for electricity generation, by reducing the number and size of passenger cars and by reducing the environmental impacts from the construction of these vehicles.},

We can use current energy use scenarios to help us to understand how energy systems could change. Such scenarios are not an exercise in prophecy; rather they are designed to challenge our thinking in order to make better decisions today. The conventional modeling approach tends to extrapolate changes in energy consumption from historical trends; however, technology innovation sometimes causes drastic reforms in energy systems in the industrial, commercial, residential and transportation sectors. The economic aspects are another key issue to be considered in order to understand future changes in energy systems. The quantity of the energy supply is set to meet the price of the energy demand of end users. This occurs on the condition that the price of the energy supply equates with the price on the demand side under the market mechanism. This paper reviews the various issues associated with the energy-economic model and its application to national energy policies, renewable energy systems, and the global environment.},

  abstract = {The composition of electricity varies significantly throughout the year. As a result, the environmental impact of the electricity mix is also highly variable. However, most LCA studies assume a static annual average electricity mix and neglect these fluctuations. Therefore, this study examines the time-varying environmental impacts of electricity generation in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Poland using a dynamic life cycle assessment. It shows that the impacts of environmental categories vary considerably depending on when the electricity is generated, resulting from the different energy generation patterns throughout the day and year. In particular, the integration of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic systems and wind turbines leads to significant fluctuations of environmental impacts. To determine the magnitude of the variation, coefficients of variation are calculated for each environmental impact category for a representative year. High coefficients of variation of more than 20\% can be observed for several environmental impact categories. In addition, both a productionbased and a consumption-based approach were used for the dynamic life cycle assessment. Comparing these two approaches shows significant differences in impact category results, for example, for Italy, with an average of 15\%. These differences highlight the importance of including cross-border electricity flows in assessing the environmental profile of electricity. Overall, the results of the study emphasize the need to implement dynamic electricity mix models in life cycle assessments, especially for systems with time-varying electricity consumption. The provided Excel spreadsheet files with hourly time profiles of environmental impacts for the countries studied facilitate the adoption of the developed models by other practitioners and provide a valuable tool for assessing environmental impacts.},

However, many countries such as Spain have not yet set binding policy targets in this regard. When compared to a business-as-usual situation, this work evaluates the life-cycle consequences of the increased electricity demand of the Spanish road transport technology mix until 2050. This is done by combining Life Cycle Assessment and Energy Systems Modelling under three alternative scenarios based on the low, medium, or high penetration rate of EV. In all cases, EV deployment is found to involve a relatively small percentage ({$<$}4\%) of the final electricity demand. Wind power and waste-to-energy plants arise as the main technologies responsible for meeting the increased electricity demand associated with EV penetration. When considering a high market penetration (20 million EV by 2050), the highest annual impacts potentially caused by the additional electricity demand are 0.93 Mt CO2 eq, 0.25 kDALY, and 30.34 PJ in terms of climate change, human health, and resources, respectively. Overall, EV penetration is concluded to slightly affect the national power generation sector, whereas it could dramatically reduce the life-cycle impacts associated with conventional transport.},

  abstract = {Fuel cell electric vehicles arise as an alternative to conventional vehicles in the road transport sector. They could contribute to decarbonising the transport system because they have no direct CO2 emissions during the use phase. In fact, the life-cycle environmental performance of hydrogen as a transportation fuel focuses on its production. In this sense, through the case study of Spain, this article prospectively assesses the techno-economic and environmental performance of a national hydrogen production mix by following a methodological framework based on energy systems modelling enriched with endogenous carbon footprint indicators. Taking into account the need for a hydrogen economy based on clean options, alternative scenarios characterised by carbon footprint restrictions with respect to a fossil-based scenario dominated by steam methane reforming are evaluated. In these scenarios, the steam reforming of natural gas still arises as the key hydrogen production technology in the short term, whereas water electrolysis is the main technology in the medium and long term. Furthermore, in scenarios with very restrictive carbon footprint limits, biomass gasification also appears as a key hydrogen production technology in the long term. In the alternative scenarios assessed, the functional substitution of hydrogen for conventional fossil fuels in the road transport sector could lead to high greenhouse gas emission savings, ranging from 36 to 58 Mt CO2 eq in 2050. Overall, these findings and the model structure and characterisation developed for the assessment of hydrogen energy scenarios are expected to be relevant not only to the specific case study of Spain but also to analysts and decision-makers in a large number of countries facing similar concerns.},

We use the TIAM-World model that relies on the TIMES modelling approach. Its climate module is inspired by the DICE model. Using robust optimization techniques, we assess the impact of the climate system parameter uncertainty on energy transition pathways under various climate constraints. Unlike other studies we consider all the climate system parameters which is of primary importance since: (i) parameters and outcomes of climate models are all inherently uncertain (parametric uncertainty); and (ii) the simplified models at stake summarize phenomena that are by nature complex and non-linear in a few, sometimes linear, equations so that structural uncertainty is also a major issue. The use of robust optimization allows us to identify economic energy transition pathways under climate constraints for which the outcome scenarios remain relevant for any realization of the climate parameters. In this sense, transition pathways are made robust. We find that the abatement strategies are quite different between the two temperature targets. The most stringent one is reached by investing massively in carbon removal technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) which have yields much lower than traditional fossil fuelled technologies.},

Resource-efficiency and circular-economy strategies, both industry and demand-focused, promise emission reductions through reducing material use, but detailed assessments of their GHG reduction potential are lacking. We present a global-scale analysis of material efficiency for passenger vehicles and residential buildings. We estimate future changes in material flows and energy use due to increased yields, light design, material substitution, extended service life, and increased service efficiency, reuse, and recycling. Together, these strategies can reduce cumulative global GHG emissions until 2050 by 20--52 Gt CO               2               -eq (residential buildings) and 13--26 Gt CO               2               e-eq (passenger vehicles), depending on policy assumptions. Next to energy efficiency and low-carbon energy supply, material efficiency is the third pillar of deep decarbonization for these sectors. For residential buildings, wood construction and reduced floorspace show the highest potential. For passenger vehicles, it is ride sharing and car sharing.},

This paper presents an extension of industry modelling within the REMIND integrated assessment model to industry subsectors and a projection of future industry subsector activity and energy demand for different baseline scenarios for use with the REMIND model. The industry sector is the largest greenhouse-gas-emitting energy demand sector and is considered a mitigation bottleneck. At the same time, industry subsectors are heterogeneous and face distinct emission mitigation challenges. By extending the multi-region, general equilibrium integrated assessment model REMIND to an explicit representation of four industry subsectors (cement, chemicals, steel, and other industry production), along with subsector-specific carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), we are able to investigate industry emission mitigation strategies in the context of the entire energy--economy--climate system, covering mitigation options ranging from reduced demand for industrial goods, fuel switching, and electrification to endogenous energy efficiency increases and carbon capture. We also present the derivation of both activity and final energy demand trajectories for the industry subsectors for use with the REMIND model in baseline scenarios, based on short-term continuation of historic trends and long-term global convergence. The system allows for selective variation of specific subsector activity and final energy demand across scenarios and regions to create consistent scenarios for a wide range of socioeconomic drivers and scenario story lines, like the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).},

However, when applying the prevailing status-quo Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to future renewable energy systems, one does not distinguish between impacts which are `imported' into the system due to the `background system' (e.g. due to supply of materials or final energy for the production of the energy system), and what is the improvement potential of these technologies compared to competitors (e.g. due to process and system innovations or diffusion effects). This paper investigates a dynamic approach towards the LCA of renewable energy technologies and proves that for all renewable energy chains, the inputs of finite energy resources and emissions of greenhouse gases are extremely low compared with the conventional system. With regard to the other environmental impacts the findings do not reveal any clear verdict for or against renewable energies.},

In particular, the interpretation of the downstream feedback term, Cd, is discussed with particular focus on practical implementation. In this paper, two interpretations of Cd are suggested depending on the particular LCA data used. If the LCA data is designed for a demand on the functional unit only, then it is argued that the Cd term is negligible in many applications. If the LCA data is compatible with an arbitrary demand, then it is argued that in many cases the consistent use of the Cd term implies data requirements that may not be justified by the potential gains. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making. \& 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A collection of methods, approaches, applications, specific software packages, and insights regarding experiences and progress made in applying the LCA methodology coupled to optimization frameworks is provided, and general trends are identified. The ``cradle-to-gate'' concept to define the system boundaries is the most used approach in practice, instead of the ``cradle-to-grave'' approach. Normally, the relationship between inventory data and impact category indicators is linearly expressed by the characterization factors; then, synergic effects of the contaminants are neglected. Among the LCIA methods, the eco-indicator 99, which is based on the endpoint category and the panel method, is the most used in practice. A single environmental impact function, resulting from the aggregation of environmental impacts, is formulated as the environmental objective in most analyzed cases. SimaPro is the most used software for LCA applications in literature analyzed. The multi-objective optimization is the most used approach for dealing with this kind of problems, where the {$\varepsilon$}-constraint method for generating the Pareto set is the most applied technique. However, a renewed interest in formulating a single economic objective function in optimization frameworks can be observed, favored by the development of life cycle cost software and progress made in assessing costs of environmental externalities. Finally, a trend to deal with multi-period scenarios into integrated LCA-optimization frameworks can be distinguished providing more accurate results upon data availability.},

  abstract = {Given a fixed product system model, with the current computational framework of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) the potential environmental impacts associated to demanding one thousand units of a product will be one thousand times larger than what results from demanding 1 unit only -- a linear relationship. However, due to economies of scale, industrial synergies, efficiency gains, and system design, activities at different scales will perform differently in terms of life cycle impact -- in a non-linear way. This study addresses the issue of using the linear framework of LCA to study scalable and emerging technologies, by looking at different examples where technology scale up reflects non-linearly on the impact of a product. First, a computer simulation applied to an entire database is used to quantitatively estimate the effect of assuming activities in a product system are subject to improvements in efficiency. This provides a theoretical but indicative idea of how much uncertainty can be introduced by non-linear relationships between input values and results at the database level. Then the non-linear relations between the environmental burden per tkm of transport on one end, and the cargo mass and range autonomy on the other end is highlighted using a parametrized LCA model for heavy goods vehicles combined with learning scenarios that reflect different load factors and improvement in battery technology. Finally, a last example explores the case of activities related to the mining of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, an emerging technology, and how the impact of scaling the Bitcoin mining production is affected non-linearly by factors such as increase in mining efficiency and geographical distribution of miners. The paper concludes by discussing the relation between non-linearity and uncertainty and by providing recommendations for accounting for non-linearity in prospective LCA studies.},

Furthermore, this work assesses the impacts of enacting a tax on LCA-GHG emissions as a strategy to mitigate climate change. To this end, a model that integrates regional life cycle data with optimised energy scenarios was developed using the MESSAGE-Brazil integrated model. Following a baseline trend, the power sector in Brazil would increasingly rely on conventional coal technologies. GHG emissions from the power sector in 2050 are expected to increase 15-fold. When enacting a tax on directcarbon emissions, advanced coal and onshore wind technologies become competitive. GHG emissions peak at 2025 and decrease afterwards, reaching an emission level 40\% lower in 2050 than that of 2010. However, if impacts were evaluated through the entire life cycle of power supply systems, LCA-GHG emissions would be 50\% higher in 2050 than in 2010. This is due to loads associated with the construction of plant infrastructures and extraction and processing of fossil fuel resources. Thus, taxes might not be as effective in tackling GHG emissions as shown by past studies, if they are only applied to direct emissions.},

Four scenarios were designed assuming different shares of energy sources in a 2030 timeframe. Applying a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, scenarios were assessed in terms of cumulative non-renewable energy (NRE) consumption, global warming potential (GWP), terrestrial acidification potential (TAP), and particulate matter formation (PMF). Additionally electricity generation costs were evaluated. Results demonstrate that the current dependence on fossil fuel is unfeasible in the long run, as it results in 14\% higher NRE consumption, an increase of 32\% on GHG emissions, 29\% on TAP and 34\% on PMF, and 9\% higher cost than the baseline scenario under preFukushima conditions. On the other hand, a share of up to 27\% of renewable energies is technically possible and would result in a 34\% reduction of NRE consumption, 29\% decrease of GHG emissions, and contribute to the mitigation of 24\% of TAP and PMF impacts, at minor increase of levelized costs. Increasing the share of renewables and phasing-out thermal power would therefore increase the resilience of the Japanese economy toward external oil markets, cope with environmental protection priorities, while promoting economic development.},

Moreover, this paper identifies that the main challenges of this research field rotate around the concept of resolution. A matrix of challenges in which four main fields are identified: resolution in time, in space, in techno-economic detail and in sector-coupling. These main fields are divided into different levels of resolution: low, medium and high. The use of a low resolution introduces errors in the modelling as demonstrated by different studies. Several existing bottom-up energy system models are reviewed in order to classify them according to the proposed approach and map them through the proposed matrix. 13 different models are analyzed in the category of bottom-up short-term and 9 as bottom-up long-term energy system models. The following mapping shows how several models reach a high level of resolution in one or more than one area. However, the ultimate challenge is the simultaneous achievement of high resolution in all these fields. The literature review has shown how this final aim is not reached by any model at the current stage and it highlights the gap and weaknesses of this branch of research and the direction versus which is important to work to improve this type of modelling.},

Performing a prospective life cycle assessment for two promising technologies in a series of climate change mitigation scenarios, we find that electricity sector decarbonization and DAC technology improvements are both indispensable to avoid environmental problem-shifting. Decarbonizing the electricity sector improves the sequestration efficiency, but also increases the terrestrial ecotoxicity and metal depletion levels per tonne of CO               2               sequestered via DAC. These increases can be reduced by improvements in DAC material and energy use efficiencies. DAC exhibits regional environmental impact variations, highlighting the importance of smart siting related to energy system planning and integration. DAC deployment aids the achievement of long-term climate targets, its environmental and climate performance however depend on sectoral mitigation actions, and thus should not suggest a relaxation of sectoral decarbonization targets.},

  abstract = {The adverse environmental consequences and diminishing trend of fossil fuel reserves indicate a serious need for vibrant and judicious energy policy. Energy policy involves a number of stakeholders, and needs to incorporate the interests and requirements of all the key stakeholder groups. This paper presents a methodological technique to assist with formulating, evaluating, and promoting the energy policy of a country in a transparent and representative way with clear scientific justifications and balanced assessments. The multicriteria decision analysis approach has been a widely used technique for evaluating different alternatives based on the interests of a multitude of stakeholders, and goals. This paper utilizes the SMAA (Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis) tool, which can evaluate different alternatives by incorporating multiple criteria, in order to examine the preferences of different policy elements. We further extend this technique by incorporating the LEAP model (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system) to assess the emission impacts of different policy elements. We demonstrate the application of this evaluation technique by an analysis of four hypothetical policy elements namely Business-as usual (BAU), Renewables (REN), Renewable-biomass only (REN-b), and Energy conservation and efficient technologies (ECET). These are applied to the case of sharing fuel sources for power generation for the Bangladesh power sector. We found that the REN-b and REN policy elements were the best and second best alternatives with 41\% and 32\% acceptability respectively. This technique gives transparent information for choosing appropriate policy elements that aimed at sustainable energy.},

While previous studies focused mainly on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, this article assesses the extent to which EVs may contribute to reducing the UK's dependence on (mostly imported) non-renewable primary energy. The study combines a life-cycle model of a compact battery electric vehicle (BEV) with a prospective energy analysis of a range of electricity supply alternatives for the vehicle's use phase. The key metric analysed is the non-renewable cumulative energy demand (nrCED). Results show that, already under current conditions, the nr-CED of a compact BEV in the UK is lower by approximately 34\% with respect to that of an otherwise similar internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV). Such reduction is then expected to improve further under all future scenarios, indicating that a transition to EVs is indeed a recommendable option to reduce the UK's demand for non-renewable energy, especially if this is accompanied by a shift to a more renewable electric grid.},

This paper presents the results of a combined prospective net energy and environmental life cycle assessment of the UK electricity grid, based on such a scenario. The main findings are that the strategy is effective at drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions (albeit to a reduced degree with respect to the projected share of ``zero carbon'' generation taken at face value), but it entails a trade-off in terms of depletion of metal resources. The grid's potential toxicity impacts are also expected to remain substantially undiminished with respect to the present. Overall, the analysis indicates that the ``2 degrees'' scenario is environmentally sound and that it even leads to a modest increase in the net energy delivered to society by the grid (after accounting for the energy investments required to deploy all technologies).},

This transition comes with various challenges and opportunities for a sustainable evolution affecting most of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We therefore propose broadening the current metrics for sustainability in the energy system modeling field by using industrial ecology techniques to account for a conclusive set of indicators. This is pursued by including a life cycle based sustainability assessment into an energy system model considering all relevant products and processes of the global supply chain. We identify three pronounced features: (i) the low-hanging fruit of impact mitigation requiring manageable economic effort; (ii) embodied emissions of renewables cause increasing spatial redistribution of impact from direct emissions, the place of burning fuel, to indirect emissions, the location of the energy infrastructure production; (iii) certain impact categories, in which more overall sustainable systems perform worse than the cost minimal system, require a closer look. In essence, this study makes the case for future energy system modeling to include the increasingly important global supply chain and broaden the metrics of sustainability further than cost and climate change relevant emissions.},

To identify the optimal design and operation of a low-carbon system, we need to consider high temporal and spatial variability in the electricity supply, sector coupling, and environmental impacts over the whole life cycle. Incorporating such aspects in optimization models is demanding. To avoid redundant research efforts and enhance transparency, the developed models and used data sets should be shared openly. In this work, we present the SecMOD framework for multi-sector energy system optimization incorporating life-cycle assessment (LCA). The framework allows optimizing multiple sectors jointly, ranging from industrial production and their linked energy supply systems to sector-coupled national energy systems. The framework incorporates LCA to account for environmental impacts. We hence provide the first open-source framework to consistently include a holistic life-cycle perspective in multi-sector optimization by a full integration of LCA. We apply the framework to a case-study of the German sector-coupled energy system. Starting with few base technologies, we demonstrate the modular capabilities of SecMOD by the stepwise addition of technologies, sectors and existing infrastructure. Our modular open-source framework SecMOD aims to accelerate research for sustainable energy systems by combining multi-sector energy system optimization and life-cycle assessment.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400--1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2{$^\circ$}C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

The MCDA tool was used by a group of experts and academics with background in economics, engineering and environment. Regarding the totality of results, both the most and least expensive scenarios ranked first the same amount of times. These scenarios were, respectively, ``Coal'', relying mainly in new coal power plants and ``Maximum Renewable'', relying mainly in new wind and hydro power facilities. The opinions were divided towards these two solutions with different fundamental characteristics: ``Maximum Renewable'' with costs higher than ``Coal'' but leading to substantial reduction of the external energy dependency. Sensitivity analysis suggests that, although the costs are regarded as the most important criterion, those who had different rankings in their preferences have different attitudes towards other criteria.},

A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.},

Here we describe scenarios that limit end-of-century radiative forcing to 1.9\,W\,m-2, and consequently restrict median warming in the year 2100 to below 1.5\,{$^\circ$}C. We use six integrated assessment models and a simple climate model, under different socio-economic, technological and resource assumptions from five Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Some, but not all, SSPs are amenable to pathways to 1.5\,{$^\circ$}C. Successful 1.9\,W\,m-2 scenarios are characterized by a rapid shift away from traditional fossil-fuel use towards large-scale low-carbon energy supplies, reduced energy use, and carbon-dioxide removal. However, 1.9\,W\,m-2 scenarios could not be achieved in several models under SSPs with strong inequalities, high baseline fossil-fuel use, or scattered short-term climate policy. Further research can help policy-makers to understand the real-world implications of these scenarios. Scenarios that constrain end-of-century radiative forcing to 1.9\,W\,m--2, and thus global mean temperature increases to below 1.5\,{$^\circ$}C, are explored. Effective scenarios reduce energy use, deploy CO2 removal measures, and shift to non-emitting energy sources.},

  abstract = {Sustainability typically relies on the durable interaction between humans and the environment. Historically, modelling tools such as environmental-life cycle assessment (E-LCA) have been developed to address the mitigation of environmental impacts generated by human activities. More recently, social-life cycle assessment (S-LCA) methods have been proposed to investigate the social sustainability sphere, looking at the life cycle effects generated by positive or negative pressures on social endpoints (i.e. wellbeing of stakeholders). Despite this promising added value, however, S-LCA methods still show limitations and challenges to be faced, e.g. regarding the lack of high quality datasets and the implementation of consensual social impact assessment indicators. This paper discusses on the complementarity between SLCA and E-LCA towards the definition of prospective life cycle sustainability analysis (LCSA) approaches. To this aim, a case study is presented comparing (i) E-LCA results of business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios of energy supply and demand technology changes in Luxembourg, up to 2025, based on economic equilibrium modeling and hybrid life cycle inventories, with (ii) a monetary-based input-output estimation of the related changes in the societal sphere. The results show that environmental and social issues do not follow the same impact trends. While E-LCA outputs highlight contrasting patterns, they do generally underlie a relatively low decrease in the aggregated environmental burdens curve (around 20\% of decrease over the single-score impact trend over time). In contrast, social hotspots (identified in S-LCA by specific risk indicators of human rights, worker treatment, poverty, etc.) are typically increasing over time according to the growth of the final energy demand. Overall, the case study allowed identifying possible synergies and tradeoffs related to the impact of projected energy demands in Luxembourg. Despite the studied approach does not fully adopt a consequential perspective, it can be considered as a basis to develop a prospective LCSA approach, combining consequential E-LCA and S-LCA. Accordingly, we introduced the concept of ``anticipatory experiences'' on energy transition towards a low carbon society as drivers for change, observing that societal phenomena characterizing the transition of the energy systems towards lower carbon-related emissions seem to facilitate the identification of actual and potential changes that may take place within these upcoming transition processes. Such phenomena, which are somehow typical, may be used as inputs for S-LCA, so as to better defining the most likely developments of certain intervention/policies in the energy sector and eventually contribute to the definition of prospective and consequential LCSA modelling tools.},

Characterization factors for direct use in the LCIA phase of a life cycle assessment, or other life-cycle based assessment, were developed for a total of 85 elementary flows recognized as dominant contributors to transgressing specific Planetary Boundaries. Exception was made for ``biosphere integrity'' and ``introduction of novel entities'' where a Planetary Boundary is yet to be defined for the latter and characterization models are considered immature for the former. The PB-LCIA can be used to quantify the share of the ``safe operating space'' that human activities occupy, as was illustrated by calculating indicator scores for about 10,600 products, technologies and services exemplifying several sectors, including materials, energy, transport, and processing. The PB-LCIA can be used by companies interested in gauging their activities against the Planetary Boundaries to support decisions that help to reduce the risk of human activities moving the Earth System out of the Holocene state.},

In AESAs, the safe operating space must be distributed among human activities so impacts associated with an activity can be related to its assigned share of the safe operating space to assess if the activity can be considered absolute sustainable. To ensure choices concerning sharing principles in AESA are deliberate, there is a need for understanding the distributive justice theory underlying the sharing principles. This study provides a framework for determining and communicating the distributive justice theories that underlie the choice of sharing principles in AESA. To comprehensively describe a sharing principle in relation to distributive justice theories, seven dimensions must be defined, i.e. target, currency, pattern, geographical scope, temporal scope, clauses, and constraints. We conducted a review of sharing principles used in AESAs in relation to contemporary distributive justice theories. 18 studies were identified with 34 sharing principles being applied. The most commonly applied sharing principle is equal per capita sharing of the safe operating space among countries or individuals. This was often combined with utilitarian principles for sharing among industrial units. Based on the review and analysis of the results, we provide recommendations on best practice for defining sharing principles in AESAs systematically based on distributive justice theories and recommendations for further research. The framework developed in this study provide a first step towards a systematic and informed selection of sharing principles used in AESAs.},

By 2040, battery and fuel cell electric trucks appear to be promising options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per ton-km on long distance segments, even where the required range autonomy is high. This requires that various conditions are met, such as improvements at the energy storage level and a drastic reduction of the greenhouse gas intensity of the electricity used for battery charging and hydrogen production. Meanwhile, these options may be considered for urban and regional applications, where they have a competitive advantage thanks to their superior engine efficiency. Finally, these alternative options will have to compete against more mature combustion-based technologies which, despite lower drivetrain efficiencies, are expected to reduce their exhaust emissions via engine improvements, hybridization of their powertrain, as well as the use of biomass-based and synthetic fuels.},

Yet, as energy systems and industries are rapidly shifting towards cleaner means of production, pLCA requires an inventory database that encapsulates the expected changes in technol\- ogies and the environment at a given point in time, following specific socio-techno-economic pathways. To this end, this study introduces premise, a tool to streamline the generation of prospective inventory databases for pLCA by integrating scenarios generated by Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). More precisely, premise applies a number of transformations on energy-intensive activities found in the inventory database ecoinvent according to projections provided by the IAM. Unsurprisingly, the study shows that, within a given socio-economic narrative, the climate change mitigation target chosen affects the performance of nearly all activities in the database. This is illustrated by focusing on the effects observed on a few activities, such as systems for direct air capture of CO2, lithium-ion batteries, electricity and clinker production as well as freight transport by road, in relation to the applied sector-based transformation and the chosen climate change mitigation target. This work also discusses the limitations and challenges faced when coupling IAM and LCA databases and what improve\- ments are to be brought in to further facilitate the development of pLCA.},

In this study, the impacts of production and consumption of the European Union in 2010 were assessed by means of life cycle assessment (LCA)-based indicators and compared with the PBs. Five different perspectives were adopted for assessing the impacts: a production perspective (EU Domestic Footprint) and four distinct consumption perspectives, resulting from alternative modelling approaches including both top-down (input-output LCA) and bottom-up (process-based LCA). Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results were assessed against LCIA-based PBs, which adapted the PBs framework to the LCIA indicators and metrics of the Environmental Footprint method (EF). Global environmental impacts transgressed several LCIAbased PBs. When assessing the overall environmental impacts of EU consumption compared to the global LCIA-based PBs, impacts of EU consumption related to climate change, particulate matter, land use and mineral resources were close or already transgressed the global boundaries. The EU, with less than 10\% of the world population, was close to transgress the global ecological limits. Moreover, when downscaling the global PBs and comparing the impacts per capita for an average EU citizen and a global one, the LCIA-PBs were significantly transgressed in many impact categories. The results are affected by uncertainty mainly due to: (a) the intrinsic uncertainties of the different LCA modelling approaches and indicators; (b) the uncertainties in estimating LCIAbased PBs, due to the difficulties in identifying limits for the Earth's processes and referring them to LCIA metrics. The results may anyway be used to define benchmarks and policy targets to ensure that consumption and production in Europe remains within safe ecological boundaries, as well as to understand the magnitude of the effort needed to reduce the impacts.},

These scenarios include a baseline trend and low carbon policy scenarios based on carbon taxes and carbon emission limits. To support the applied methodology, a questionnaire was elaborated to integrate the perceptions of experts on the scenario evaluation process. Considering the results from multi-criteria analysis, scenario preference followed the order of increasing share of renewables in the power sector. The preferable option for the future Brazilian power sector is a scenario where wind and biomass have a major contribution. The robustness of the multi-criteria tool applied in this study was tested by a sensitivity analysis. This analysis demonstrated that, regardless of the respondents' preferences and backgrounds, scenarios with higher shares of fossil fuel sources are the least preferable option, while scenarios with major contributions from wind and biomass are the preferable option to supply electricity in Brazil through 2050.},

The lack of transparency and standardization, however, renders the assessment of model suitability for specific policy questions difficult. Therefore, this paper systematically assesses the ability of energy system models to answer major energy policy questions. It examines the existing literature on model comparison schemes, then proposes a set of criteria to compare a sample of 40 models. Besides, a novel, model-oriented approach is developed in order to cluster energy policy questions. Finally, the model capabilities and the policy questions are brought together by quantifying the gap between models and policy questions. The results show that some models are very well able to answer a wide range of energy policy questions, whereas others are only suitable for a specific area of energy policy. The representation of the distribution grid, the endogenous adjustment of demand, and the technical flexibility of the energy system are among the features, where models generally lag behind. Our results provide policy-makers with guidance on crucial model features with respect to a selection of energy policy questions and suggest potential funding priorities for future energy system modeling.},

We propose an integration approach that uses industry-level work environment characterization factors (WE-CFs) to convert industry activity into damage to human health attributable to the work environment, assessed as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). WE-CFs are ratios of work-related fatal and nonfatal injuries and illnesses occurring in the U.S. worker population to the amount of physical output from U.S. industries; they represent workplace hazards and exposures and are compatible with the life cycle inventory (LCI) structure common to process-based LCA. A proof of concept demonstrates application of the WE-CFs in an LCA of municipal solid waste landfill and incineration systems. Results from the proof of concept indicate that estimates of DALYs attributable to the work environment are comparable in magnitude to DALYs attributable to environmental emissions. Construction and infrastructure-related work processes contributed the most to the work environment DALYs. A sensitivity analysis revealed that uncertainty in the physical output from industries had the most effect on the WE-CFs. The results encourage implementation of WE-CFs in future LCA studies, additional refinement of LCI processes to accurately capture industry outputs, and inclusion of infrastructure-related processes in LCAs that evaluate OSH impacts.},

  abstract = {To assess the potential environmental impact of human/industrial systems, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a very common method. There are two prominent types of LCA, namely attributional (ALCA) and consequential (CLCA). A lot of literature covers these approaches, but a general consensus on what they represent and an overview of all their differences seems lacking, nor has every prominent feature been fully explored. The two main objectives of this article are: (1) to argue for and select definitions for each concept and (2) specify all conceptual characteristics (including translation into modelling restrictions), re-evaluating and going beyond findings in the state of the art. For the first objective, mainly because the validity of interpretation of a term is also a matter of consensus, we argue the selection of definitions present in the 2011 UNEP-SETAC report. ALCA attributes a share of the potential environmental impact of the world to a product life cycle, while CLCA assesses the environmental consequences of a decision (e.g., increase of product demand). Regarding the second objective, the product system in ALCA constitutes all processes that are linked by physical, energy flows or services. Because of the requirement of additivity for ALCA, a double-counting check needs to be executed, modelling is restricted (e.g., guaranteed through linearity) and partitioning of multifunctional processes is systematically needed (for evaluation per single product). The latter matters also hold in a similar manner for the impact assessment, which is commonly overlooked. CLCA, is completely consequential and there is no limitation regarding what a modelling framework should entail, with the coverage of co-products through substitution being just one approach and not the only one (e.g., additional consumption is possible). Both ALCA and CLCA can be considered over any time span (past, present \& future) and either using a reference environment or different scenarios. Furthermore, both ALCA and CLCA could be specific for average or marginal (small) products or decisions, and further datasets. These findings also hold for life cycle sustainability assessment.},

  abstract = {Humanity is continuing a path towards ecological instability. While resource consumption is unprecedented, significant parts of the human population are still deprived of decent living. The safe and just operating space postulates that it is possible to simultaneously stay within ecological limits and fulfil basic needs. However, evidence that such a state can be achieved given existing population and available technologies is lacking. Here, we attempt to show whether a safe and just space exists by modelling material and energy requirements for satisfying basic needs with various technological scenarios. Environmental impacts of a basket of products representing basic needs satisfaction are measured through life cycle analysis and compared to planetary boundaries for the first time. We find that all planetary boundaries considered can be respected for 8.0 and 10.4 billion people with a probability of 81\% and 73\% respectively. However, this requires a fossil-free energy system, and an essentially vegan diet as well as no additional cropland conversion. To actually create and enlarge a safe and just operating space, carbon dioxide emissions, biodiversity, Phosphorus and Nitrogen emissions would need to be further reduced, mainly by improved agricultural practices and material circularity. Significance Statement The purpose of this study is to find out if humanity can fulfil basic needs for all humans without destabilizing the Earth system. This information is relevant for identifying pathways to futures in which all humans can live good lives without compromising the livelihoods of future generations. Our results show that it is theoretically possible to satisfy the basic needs of 10.4 billion people within ecological limits. However, large-scale transformations in all sectors and dietary changes are necessary to guarantee safe climate conditions.},

  abstract = {A successful decarbonisation of the European Union, coupled with a high integration of renewable energy and ambitious targets for energy efficiency, can only be reached with a significant contribution from the transportation sector. It currently represents a quarter of the total greenhouse gas emissions and is shifting from fossil fuels to alternative energy carriers (biofuels, e-hydrogen, electricity) and propulsion systems (hybrid, electric and fuel-cell vehicles). Decarbonising this sector can follow multiple pathways, each having different costs, impacts and implications for the other sectors (industry, residential and services). This paper presents a method to analyse the impact of each decarbonisation pathway in the mobility sector on the overall energy system, using the EnergyScope model. The proposed methods include: (i) an estimation of the hourly demand profiles for short- (local) and long-distance mobility, using annual projections and traffic measurements; (ii) the development of black-box vehicle models of road, rail and aviation technologies; (iii) the modelling of the associated infrastructures, from the fuel conversion processes to the charging stations; and (iv) the use of Monte-Carlobased tools to account for technical and economic uncertainties. This method allows to assess the effects of mobility decarbonisation pathways on the energy system, from the large-scale deployment of vehicle-to-grid technologies to the integration of biofuel- and hydrogen-based vehicles. France has been taken as case study, considering 2050 as time horizon. The results showed the importance of a holistic approach to suggest costand energy-efficient decarbonisation pathways in the transport sector that can affect the overall energy system.},

  abstract = {The transition towards renewable energy is leading to an important strain on the energy grids. The question of designing and deploying renewable energy technologies in symbiosis with existing grids and infrastructure is arising. While current energy system models mainly focus on the energy transformation system or only investigate the effect on one energy vector grid, we present a methodology to characterize different energy vector grids and storage, integrated into the multi-energy and multi-sector modeling framework EnergyScope. The characterization of energy grids is achieved through a traditional energy technology and grid modeling approach, integrating economic and technical parameters. The methodology has been applied to the case study of a country with a high existing transmission infrastructure density, e.g., Switzerland, switching from a fossil fuel-based system to a high share of renewable energy deployment. The results show that the economic optimum with high shares of renewable energy requires the electric distribution grid reinforcement with 2.439~GW (+61\%) Low Voltage (LV) and 4.626~GW (+82\%) Medium Voltage (MV), with no reinforcement required at transmission level [High Voltage (HV) and Extra High Voltage (EHV)]. The reinforcement is due to high shares of LV-Photovoltaic (PV) (15.4~GW) and MV-wind (20~GW) deployment. Without reinforcement, additional biomass is required for methane production, which is stored in 4.8--5.95~TWh methane storage tanks to compensate for seasonal intermittency using the existing gas infrastructure. In contrast, hydro storage capacity is used at a maximum of 8.9~TWh. Furthermore, the choice of less efficient technologies to avoid reinforcement results in a 8.5\%--9.3\% cost penalty compared to the cost of the reinforced system. This study considers a geographically averaged and aggregated model, assuming all production and consumption are made in one single spot, not considering the role of future decentralization of the energy system, leading to a possible overestimation of grid reinforcement needs.},

This transformation requires innovative methods to integrate stochastic renewable sources such as solar and wind power and challenging traditional energy paradigms rooted in centralized and continuous energy production. The present study focuses on the Swiss energy system to explore the optimization of energy planning strategies that incorporate decentralized energy production within a centralized framework. Here, we show that a strategic approach to decentralization can significantly reduce annual system costs by 10\% to CHF 1230 per capita and increase self-consumption to 68\% of the decentralized PV production, emphasizing the need for a hybrid energy-planning model that balances centralized and decentralized models for enhanced system resilience, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. This research underscores the strategic importance of diversifying energy sources, enhancing energy storage, improving grid flexibility, and laying a foundational framework for policy making and strategic planning. It encourages further investigation into climate impacts, technology synergy, and the integration of district heating, aiming to establish a resilient, sustainable, and autonomous energy future.},

  abstract = {In this early 21st century, our societies have to face a tremendous and increasing energy need while mitigating the global climate change and preserving the environment. Addressing this challenge requires an energy transition from the current fossil energy-based system to a carbon-free energy production system, based on a relevant energy mix combining renewables and nuclear energy. However, such an energy transition will only occur if it is accepted by the population. Powerful and reliable tools, such as life cycle assessments (LCA), aiming at assessing the respective merits of the different energy mix for most of the environmental impact indicators are therefore mandatory for supporting a risk-informed decision-process at the societal level. Before studying the deployment of a given energy mix, a prerequisite is to perform LCAs on each of the components of the mix. This paper addresses two potential nuclear energy components: a nuclear fuel cycle based on the Generation III European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) and a nuclear fuel cycle based on the Generation IV Sodium Fast Reactors (SFR). The basis of this study relies on the previous work done on the current French nuclear fuel cycle using the bespoke NELCAS tool specifically developed for studying nuclear fuel cycle environmental impacts. Our study highlights that the EPR already brings a limited improvement to the current fuel cycle thanks to a higher efficiency of the energy transformation and a higher burn-up of the nuclear fuel (-20\% on most of the chosen indicators) whereas the introduction of the GEN IV fast reactors will bring a significant breakthrough by suppressing the current front-end of the fuel cycle thanks to the use of depleted uranium instead of natural enriched uranium (this leads to a decrease of the impact from 17\% on water consumption and withdrawal and up to 96\% on SOx emissions). The specific case of the radioactive waste is also studied, showing that only the partitioning and transmutation of the americium in the blanket fuel of the SFR can reduce the footprint of the geological disposal (saving up to a factor of 7 on the total repository volume). Having now at disposition five models (open fuel cycle, current French twice through fuel cycle, EPR twice through fuel cycle, multi-recycling SFR fuel cycle and at a longer term, multi-recycling SFR fuel cycle including americium transmutation), it is possible to model the environmental impact of any fuel cycle combining these technologies. In the next step, these models will be combined with those of other carbon-free energies (wind, solar, biomass . . . ) in order to estimate the environmental impact of future energy mixes and also to analyze the impact on the way these scenarios are deployed (transition pathways).},

  abstract = {One of the purposes of the Circular Economy is to promote the optimization of resources; most power systems planning towards renewable energy focus on the operation phase. In this sense, innovative Circular Economy indicators play a fundamental role in planning electricity generation due to the massive electrification of eco\- nomic activities, offering the option of using fewer material resources in the system infrastructure to reduce the depletion of non-renewable resources. Therefore, when planning a power supply system, it is essential to assess technical, environmental, and economic aspects to guarantee the system's proper functioning and an infra\- structure design with the minimum impact. This work presents a mathematical programming approach that aims to introduce rigorous metrics on the requirements of non-renewable resources used during the process and en\- ergy self-sufficiency since they have not been studied as one of the aspects of the Circular Economy within the energy sector. In addition, the model determines the optimal selection of the required infrastructure and necessary capacities in energy production to satisfy the energy demand required in a specific period. Together, the quantification of materials is normalized using the Abiotic Depletion Potential as a comparison of the depletion of non-renewable resources. The proposed Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) multiobjective model is solved using the goal programming technique, allowing to determine the compensations between the total cost, CO2eq emissions (related to the production of energy in the different energy generating technologies) and Circular Economy indicators. A case study for power generation in Mexico is presented and the results show that by implementing Circular Economy indicators as an addition to the economic and environ\- mental functions, ``achievement in performance'' for the different objectives ranges from 84.00 \% and 89.96 \%. In addition, the optimization shows a 76.17 \% decrease in the total cost and 48.73 \% in CO2eq emissions concerning the respective worst case (Nadir point). This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on the inte\- gration of Circular Economy metrics, specifically in optimizing the energy sector.},

It takes into account a range of criteria to reflect relevant environmental, social and economic considerations, capture the value of diversity, and reflect innovative potential and learning capacity. The combination of these factors allows for solutions in which there is more balance between economic, environmental and social dimensions, unlike in previous studies. Scenarios that might have been preferred on the basis of, for example, minimal costs or low CO2 emissions, will have to be reconsidered because of negative effects in terms of land use or unemployment. The decision making philosophy in this case changes from that of optimization to multi-criteria satisficing. This article argues for consideration of the following dimensions of the energy system: costs, emissions, water use, land use and employment. Consideration of such dimensions will shift energy system into the direction of overall sustainability while making it more resilient in the long-term. The approach is applied to the case of the United Kingdom by making use of a MARKAL model, complementing its goal of cost-minimization with additional, social and environmental criteria. This gives rise to a number of suggestions for UK energy mix and policy.},

  abstract = {Carbon capture and storage can both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide negative emissions to contribute to the transition to a net-zero society. The contribution of carbon capture and storage has been investigated within cross-sectorial energy system models. However, such models commonly focus on cost and greenhouse gas emissions, while broader environmental impacts are investigated for individual technologies only. Here, we analyze economic and environmental impacts of the transition to net-zero emissions by combining energy system modeling with life-cycle assessment. We focus on the system-wide implications of carbon dioxide storage on economic or environmental impacts. In our investigation of the transition of the German energy system until 2045, net-zero emissions require a minimal amount of carbon capture and storage. However, increasing carbon dioxide storage beyond the minimum amount significantly lowers cost and environmental impacts in up to 13 out of 16 impact categories by avoiding investments into material-intensive technologies, such as power-to-methane or renewable power plants in areas with low generation potential. In scenarios without electricity imports, carbon dioxide storage ranges between 118 Mt to 379 Mt in 2045 with cost increasing by 105 \% when carbon dioxide storage is minimized. 84 \% of the cost increase is incurred for eliminating the final 23 Mt of carbon dioxide stored.},

Considering Germany as a case study, we extend the common focus on climate change in sustainable energy system design to seven additional Earth-system processes crucial for maintaining conditions favorable to human well-being. Our assessment reveals that transitioning to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions reduces many environmental impacts but is not equivalent to sustainability, as all net-zero designs transgress at least one planetary boundary. However, the environmental impacts vary substantially between net-zero designs, highlighting that design choices exist to address transgressions of planetary boundaries.},

These climate mitigation scenarios also show significantly reduced impacts of acidification, particulate matter formation and human toxicity, suggesting the existence of co-benefits. For eutrophication, all scenarios indicate substantial increases, but the increases are largest in the Baseline scenario. For photochemical oxidant formation, only the mitigation scenarios manage to stabilize this impact from fossil fuel based power production. This study does not assess the impact of alternative power generation or energy efficiency technology that replaces part of the fossil fuel power in the mitigation scenarios.},

  abstract = {Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation of climate change are the main aims of the global climate policy. Increased use of renewable energy is a central measure in achieving these goals. However, mitigation of climate change through increased use of renewable energy also has negative environmental impacts. Focusing merely on greenhouse gas emissions may lead to overseeing these other negative environmental impacts and thereby in unwanted side-effects. The aim of this review was to assess the overall life cycle impacts related to the production and use of the different renewable energy sources. Impacts were assessed for unit processes and for the Finnish national renewable energy targets as a whole. The review points out that in order to comprehensively understand the overall environmental impacts of the different renewable energy sources, a thorough life cycle assessment with a unified framework would be needed. Presently there is only limited information available or the published results are not comparable with each another. However, assessment using the Finnish National Renewable Energy Targets for 2020 also indicates that under the present targets, the overall environmental impacts of the renewable energy use are likely to be low. Main impacts or risks of impacts relate to the use of forest energy.},

  abstract = {Energy technologies are subject to dramatic cost changes. Indeed, the recent trend in investment costs (expressed in [USD/kW]) for the main renewable energy technologies showed an important cost reduction (e.g. solar PV and wind) or increase (e.g. hydro-power, geothermal energy) during the last decade. Taking these cost variations into account within the scope of a prospective energy system model such as Energyscope is therefore very important. While data concerning well-known energy technologies like solar PV and wind is widely available, emerging technologies such as electrolysis and CCUS (carbon capture, utilization and storage) have very few reliable data. Predicting their future cost is therefore a challenging task. To this end, the learning curve theory has been used. It has been widely used to model the cost reduction achieved in the industry via the learning-by-doing process, and can easily be transposed to energy technologies. The assessment of carefully selected learning curve functions applied to energy technologies historical data results in important cost changes until 2050. Indeed, the cost reduction between 2020 and 2050 of the cost-decreasing technologies under study are between 36\% (onshore wind) and 74\% (residential solar PV), with a mean over the studied technologies that equals 50\%.},

  abstract = {Decarbonising the UK electricity mix is vital to achieving the national target of 80\% reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, relative to a 1990 baseline. Much work so far has focused only on costs and GHG emissions ignoring other sustainability issues. This paper goes beyond to assess the life cycle sustainability of different electricity scenarios for the UK, extending to 2070. The scenarios include the main technologies relevant to the UK: nuclear, gas, coal with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS), wind, solar photovoltaics and biomass. Three levels of decarbonisation are considered and the implications are assessed for techno-economic, environmental and social impacts on a life cycle basis. The results show that decarbonisation is likely to increase electricity costs despite anticipated future cost reductions for immature technologies. Conversely, sensitivity to volatile fuel prices decreases by two-thirds in all the scenarios with low-carbon technologies. To meet the GHG emission targets, coal CCS can only play a limited role, contributing 10\% to the electricity mix at most; the use of CCS also increases other sustainability impacts compared to today, including worker injuries, large accident fatalities, depletion of fossil fuels and long-term waste storage. This calls into question the case for investing in coal CCS. A very low-carbon mix with nuclear and renewables provides the best overall environmental performance, but some impacts increase, such as terrestrial eco-toxicity. Such a mix also worsens some social issues such as health impacts from radiation and radioactive waste storage requirements. UK-based employment may more than double by 2070 if a renewablesintensive mix is chosen. However, the same mix also increases depletion of elements nearly seven-fold relative to the present, emphasising the need for end-of-life recycling. Very low-carbon mixes also introduce considerable uncertainty due to low dispatchability and grid instability. With equal weighting assumed for each sustainability impact, the scenario with an equal share of nuclear and renewables is ranked best.},

  abstract = {Crossing the boundaries in global sustainability                            The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen               et al.               provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context.                                         Science               , this issue               10.1126/science.1259855                        ,              Developments in the planetary boundaries concept provide a framework to support global sustainability.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.                                         RATIONALE               The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES---its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low---a ``safe operating space'' for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).                                         RESULTS               Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier ``biodiversity loss''), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs---climate change and biosphere integrity---are recognized as ``core'' PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth's surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).                                         CONCLUSIONS               PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development.                                                   Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries.                                        The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO                     2                     concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity.                                                                                            ,              The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries---climate change and biosphere integrity---have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.},

  abstract = {The Planetary Boundaries framework was developed to control the anthropogenic pressure on the Earth system and delimit a safe operating space for humanity. Within the European Union (EU), the energy sector is the most emitting sector. Many studies have investigated life cycle impacts of electricity generation, but assessments of the life cycle impacts of electricity generation in relation to the planetary boundaries are currently limited. Here, we evaluate the life cycle impacts of electricity generation in the EU-28 and relate these impacts to the planetary boundaries. Moreover, we include an assessment of impacts on the planetary boundary biosphere integrity, which has often been omitted due to its complexity and inadequate basis for quantification. Three scenarios (Base, Green, and NZE) for the period 2020--2050 are considered, and two different sharing principles are applied for assigning a share of the safe operating space to the considered system. We found that neither of the three scenarios can be considered within the boundaries of the assigned safe operating space using either of the sharing principles. All three scenarios comply with an equal number of boundaries defined by SoSOS 1 in year 2050 (7 out of 15 boundaries), but in relation to the boundaries defined by SoSOS 2 the Green scenario performs best, complying with 13 out of 15 boundaries. The good performance of the Green scenario in 2050 is especially due to the large share of renewable energy sources (74~\%) and nuclear (21~\%), and because of the inclusion of BECCS, giving negative impacts on climate change. The results of the study indicate a need for a drastic change in the electricity mix of the EU-28 towards a larger share of renewable energies and emphasize the importance of considering all planetary boundaries to avoid burden shifting and to obtain absolute environmental sustainability for EU-28 electricity generation.},

  abstract = {Raw materials and their related environmental impacts will play a key role in the implementation of renewable energy infrastructures for decarbonization. Despite the growing amount of data quantifying raw materials for energy production technologies, few examples of these data sources are being included in current energy system models. Accordingly, this paper introduces possible pathways for integrating material-specific life cycle assess\- ment outputs and material metabolism indicators into energy system models so that raw material requirements, and their associated impacts, can be accounted for. The paper discusses the availability of life cycle inventories, impact assessment methods and important output indicators. The material metabolism indicators most relevant to the current policy debate surrounding the European Green Deal--namely, material supply risk and contribution of recycled materials to total supply--are also discussed alongside the value of adding this information to energy system models. A methodology for using data from both approaches is offered and operationalised using four sub-technologies of both wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels as case studies. The results show that considerable variation exists between and within the two groups for all indicators. The technologies with the lowest global warming potential, cumulative energy demand and supply risk are turbines with gearbox doublefed induction generators and cadmium telluride photovoltaics. Furthermore, wind turbines exhibit significantly higher recycling rates than photovoltaics.

  abstract = {Direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) is an emerging carbon dioxide removal technology, which has the potential to remove large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. We present a comprehensive life cycle assessment of different DACCS systems with low-carbon electricity and heat sources required for the CO2 capture process, both stand-alone and gridconnected system configurations. The results demonstrate negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for all eight selected locations and five system layouts, with the highest GHG removal potential in countries with low-carbon electricity supply and waste heat usage (up to 97\%). Autonomous system layouts prove to be a promising alternative, with a GHG removal efficiency of 79-91\%, at locations with high solar irradiation to avoid the consumption of fossil fuel-based grid electricity and heat. The analysis of environmental burdens other than GHG emissions shows some trade-offs associated with CO2 removal, especially land transformation for system layouts with photovoltaics (PV) electricity supply. The sensitivity analysis reveals the importance of selecting appropriate locations for grid-coupled system layouts since the deployment of DACCS at geographic locations with CO2-intensive grid electricity mixes leads to net GHG emissions instead of GHG removal today.},

  abstract = {Designing decentralized energy systems in an optimal way can substantially reduce costs and environmental burdens. However, most models for the optimal design of multi-energy systems (MESs) exclude a comprehensive environmental assessment and consider limited technology options for relevant energy-intensive sectors, such as the industrial and mobility sectors. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization framework for designing MESs, which includes life cycle environmental burdens and considers a wide portfolio of technology options for residential, mobility, and industrial sectors. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program that minimizes costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while meeting the energy demands of given end-users. Whereas our MESs optimization framework can be applied for a large range of boundary conditions, the geographical island Eiger{\o}y (Norway) is used as a showcase as it includes substantial industrial activities. Results demonstrate that, when properly designed, MESs are already cost-competitive with incumbent energy systems, and significant reductions in the amount of natural gas (92\%) and GHG emissions (73\%) can be obtained with a marginal cost increase (18\%). Stricter decarbonization targets incur larger costs. A broad portfolio of technologies is deployed when minimizing GHG emissions and integrating the industrial sector. Environmental trade-offs are identified when considering the construction phase of energy technologies. Therefore, we argue that (i) MES designs and assessments require a thorough life cycle assessment beyond GHG emissions, and (ii) the entire life cycle should be considered when designing MESs, with the construction phase contributing up to 80\% of specific environmental impact categories.},

  abstract = {Emerging technologies are expected to contribute to environmental sustainable development. However, throughout the development of novel technologies, it is unknown whether emerging technologies can lead to reduced environmental impacts compared to a potentially displaced mature technology. Additionally, process steps suspected to be environmental hotspots can be improved by process engineers early in the development of the emerging technology. In order to determine the environmental impacts of emerging technologies at an early stage of development, prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) should be performed. However, consistency in prospective LCA methodology is lacking. Therefore, this article develops a framework for a prospective LCA in order to overcome the methodological inconsistencies regarding prospective LCAs. The methodological framework was developed using literature on prospective LCAs of emerging technologies, and therefore, a literature review on prospective LCAs was conducted. We found 44 case studies, four review papers, and 17 papers on methodological guidance. Three main challenges for conducting prospective LCAs are identified: Comparability, data, and uncertainty challenges. The issues in defining the aim, functionality, and system boundaries of the prospective LCAs, as well as problems with specifying LCIA methodologies, comprise the comparability challenge. Data availability, quality, and scaling are issues within the data challenge. Finally, uncertainty exists as an overarching challenge when applying a prospective LCA. These three challenges are especially crucial for the prospective assessment of emerging technologies. However, this review also shows that within the methodological papers and case studies, several approaches exist to tackle these challenges. These approaches were systematically summarized within a framework to give guidance on how to overcome the issues when conducting prospective LCAs of emerging technologies. Accordingly, this framework is useful for LCA practitioners who are analyzing early-stage technologies. Nevertheless, further research is needed to develop appropriate scale-up schemes and to include uncertainty analyses for a more in-depth interpretation of results.},

Based on this assessment framework, we developed cost-benefit analysis (CBA) case studies for a hypothetical project designed to introduce advanced fossil-fired power generation technologies in China. Our MARKAL model for Japan confirmed that radical reductions (i.e., 80 \% by 2050) of carbon dioxide (CO2) could be attained from energy systems alone and that credit for emission allowances was required. We evaluated life-cycle costs and emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur oxide, and nitrogen oxide gases for the energy technologies using an LCA model. Further, we applied a power generation planning model for six Chinese grids to provide a power mix structure, potentially producing credit by installing fossil-fired power generation technology and by using baseline grid emission factors with an average cost of electricity. Finally, by using dynamic emission reductions and additional costs from the two models, we conducted case studies of CBA for a hypothetical project to install the technologies in China. This was accomplished by evaluating emission reductions in monetary terms and by applying a life-cycle impact assessment model. A unique feature of our IA is its dynamic (timevarying) assessment of costs and benefits.},

  abstract = {Detailed analysis of pathways to future sustainable energy systems is important in order to identify and overcome potential constraints and negative impacts and to increase the utility and speed of this transition. A key aspect of a shift to renewable energy technologies is their relatively higher metal intensities. In this study a bottom-up cost-minimizing energy model is used to calculate aggregate metal requirements in different energy technology including hydrogen and climate policy scenarios and under a range of assumptions reflecting uncertainty in future metal intensities, recycling rate and life time of energy technologies. Metal requirements are then compared to current production rates and resource estimates to identify potentially ``critical'' metals. Three technology pathways are investigated: 100 percent renewables, coal \& nuclear and gas \& renewables, each under the two different climate policies: net zero emissions satisfying the well-below 2 {$^\circ$}C target and business as usual without carbon constraints, resulting together in six scenarios. The results suggest that the three different technology pathways lead to an almost identical degree of warming without any climate policy, while emissions peaks within a few decades with a 2 {$^\circ$}C policy. The amount of metals required varies significantly in the different scenarios and under the various uncertainty assumptions. However, some can be deemed ``critical'' in all outcomes, including Vanadium. The originality of this study lies in the specific findings, and in the employment of an energy model for the energy-mineral nexus study, to provide better understanding for decision making and policy development.},

  abstract = {Purpose Despite the long-standing demand for research on dynamic lifecycle assessment (LCA) for policymaking, only a few studies have addressed this subject in conjunction with other systems thinking disciplines, such as energy systems models (ESMs) and integrated assessment models (IAMs), which have achieved tremendous success in assessing climate policies in future scenarios. This study explains our methodological advances in the global application of LCA incorporated in IAMs, specifically dose-response functions, models, and future scenarios. Methods We investigate the application of the lifecycle impact assessment method based on endpoint modeling (LIME), developed under the current environmental situation in Japan and globally, to be consistent and compatible with our IAM, which comprises three resource balance models and a simplified climate model. The IAM endogenously generates most inventories consistent with energy scenarios and climate policies linked with the applied LIME. The IAM and LIME are formulated to minimize the discounted sum of supplying the cost of resources over their lifecycles (i.e., from development to end-of-life) to generate time evolutions for the endpoint impacts over this century on a global scale with/without the 2-degree Celsius (2DC) target in a 100\% renewable energy scenario. Results and discussion Unlike existing LCA+ESM/IAM studies, which focus on power generation technologies and related (in)direct embedded energy consumption on a lifecycle basis, our model's expansion to mineral and biomass resources, in addition to energy, has the following novel results: (1) The following inventories in the 2DC target are generally lower than those in business as usual (BAU): temperature and sea level rise, natural resource, and waste discharge; further, SOx emissions are significantly reduced by reducing coal production while increasing forestry. (2) The environmental impacts on the four endpoints of minerals, land use, and land-use change, with the exclusion of energy-related impacts, are significantly larger than those related to energy. (3) Finally, by ensuring inventory reduction, the 2DC target scenario can reduce overall endpoint impacts (by maximum around 20\%), except the impacts on biodiversity resulting from forestry expansion to meet predetermined targets. Conclusions Unlike mainstream IAM analyses, we incorporate LIME, instead of energy- and biomass-related resource and climate change impacts alone; our model thus provides a comprehensive perspective on various natural resources and their impacts on a lifecycle basis. The exclusion of the weighting process and retention of the four endpoints enable us to easily interpret the results. Further, this application of LCA to IAM enables us to further understand and assess natural resources and environmental impacts.},

Cumulative Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions per kWh electricity produced are shown in order to provide the basis for comparison with existing literature. Minimising negative impacts on human health is one of the key elements of policy making towards sustainable development: besides their direct impacts on quality of life, HHI also trigger other impacts, e.g. external costs in the health care system. These HHI are measured using the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods ``ReCiPe'' with its three different perspectives and ``IMPACT2002 {\th}''. Total HHI as well as the shares of the contributing damage categories vary largely between these perspectives and methods. Impacts due to climate change, human toxicity, and particulate matter formation are the main contributors to total HHI. Independently of the perspective chosen, the overall impacts on human health from nuclear power and renewables are substantially lower than those caused by coal power, while natural gas can have lower HHI than nuclear and some renewables. Fossil fuel combustion as well as coal, uranium and metal mining are the life cycle stages generating the highest HHI.},

In this study the environmental impact of a future (2030) possible low-carbon electricity system in Denmark was assessed and compared with the current situation (2010) and an alternative 2030 scenario using life cycle assessment (LCA). The influence on the final results of the modeling approach used for (i) electricity import, (ii) biomass resources, and (iii) the cogeneration of heat and power was discussed. The results showed that consumption of fossil resources and global warming impacts from the Danish electricity sector could be reduced significantly compared with 2010. Nevertheless, a reduction in GHG may be at the expense of other environmental impacts, such as the increased depletion of abiotic resources. Moreover, the results were very dependent upon biomass origin: when agricultural land was affected by biomass import, and land use changes and transportation were included, GHG emissions from imported biomass were comparable to those from fossil fuels. The results were significantly influenced by the modeling approach regarding the import of electricity, biomass provision, and the allocation between heat and power in cogeneration plants. As the importance of all three aspects is likely to increase in the future, transparency in LCA modeling is critical. Characterized impacts for Danish power plants in 2010 and 2030 (including corresponding electricity supply mixes) were provided, thus enabling future LCA studies to include appropriately impacts from the Danish electricity sector.},

Our approach consists in deriving minimum cost solutions for achieving progressive emission reductions up to 2050 using the North American TIMES Energy Model (NATEM), a detailed multi-regional and integrated optimization energy model. With this model, we analyze a baseline and two 60\% reduction scenarios of combustion related emissions by 2050 from 1990 levels, with different assumptions regarding projected demands for energy services and availability of technology options for carbon mitigation. The first reduction scenario includes only well-known technologies while the second one considers additional disruptive technologies, which are known but are not fully developed commercially. Results show that three fundamental transformations need to occur simultaneously in order to achieve ambitious GHG emission reduction targets: electrification of end-use sectors, decarbonization of electricity generating supply, and efficiency improvements. In particular, our results show that electricity represents between 52\% and 57\% of final energy consumption by 2050, electricity generating supply achieves nearly complete decarbonization by 2025 and final energy consumption decreases by 20\% relative to the baseline by 2050.},

This integration allows for the generation of comprehensive environmental assessments of future energy systems and for determining energy scenarios with less environmental impacts and moderate cost increases. In Switzerland, which is used as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, it is possible to generate pathways with a 5\% cost increase on the cost-optimal situation, causing an impact score for climate change that is 2\% higher than the minimum feasible solution. The minimization of life-cycle impacts on climate change generates substantial environmental cobenefits with regard to human health, air pollution, ozone depletion, acidification, and land transformation. However, this minimization also creates trade-offs that exacerbate the effects of metal depletion and human toxicity caused by upstream extraction and manufacturing linked to technologies such as solar panels and electric vehicles. Finally, ambitious reduction targets of 95\% direct (i.e., within the country) CO2 emissions for the year 2050 might still result in substantial climate change impacts should emissions embodied in the infrastructure and upstream supply chain not be jointly mitigated jointly.},

This study investigated the environmental impacts of the production of cobalt and how these could change in the future. We modeled possible future developments in the cobalt supply chain using four variables: (v1) ore grade, (v2) primary market shares, (v3) secondary market shares, and (v4) energy transition. These variables are driven by two metal-demand scenarios, which we derived from scenarios from the shared socioeconomic pathways, a ``business as usual'' (BAU) and a ``sustainable development'' (SD) scenario. We estimated future environmental impacts of cobalt supply by 2050 under these two scenarios using prospective life cycle assessment. We found that the environmental impacts of cobalt production could likely increase and are strongly dependent on the recycling market share and the overall energy transition. The results showed that under the BAU scenario, climate change impacts per unit of cobalt production could increase by 9\% by 2050 compared to 2010, while they decreased by 28\% under the SD scenario. This comes at a trade-off to other impacts like human toxicity, which could strongly increase in the SD scenario (112\% increase) compared to the BAU scenario (71\% increase). Furthermore, we found that the energy transition could offset most of the increase of climate change impacts induced by a near doubling in cobalt demand in 2050 between the two scenarios.},

However, LCA practitioners and decisionmakers are often unable to prioritize environmental indicators evaluated in LCA and tend to focus on indicators they consider material from a partially subjective standpoint. The current paper showcases how a set of Planetary Boundaries-based weighting factors for issues related to Environmental Quality, Human Health and Resource Depletion, aligned with the European Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) suggested environmental indicators, was developed based on previous work done by Bj{\o}rn et al. This new set of values was then tested on several products from cosmetic company L'Or{\'e}al. Results show a clear dispersion, with several impact categories, such as Climate Change and Particulate Matter coming out as significantly more critical than other, proving the usefulness of the suggested values. And while some current limitations and possible improvements still need to be considered, the approach enriches the debate by defining thresholds for ecosystem or human resilience, thereby enabling reflection on how these issues should be collectively addressed.},

However, the development of national electricity mixes should also be sensitive to resource availability, geo-political forces, human health impacts, and social equity concerns. Policy focused on GHG goals could potentially lead to adverse consequences in other areas. To explore the impact of ``climate-centric'' policy making on long-term electricity mix changes, we develop two cases for Peru and Spain analyzing their changing electricity grids in the period 1989--2013. We perform a Life Cycle Assessment of annual electricity production to catalogue the improvements in GHG emissions relative to other environmental impacts. We conclude that policies targeting GHG reductions might have the co-benefit of also reducing air pollution and toxicity at the expense of other important environmental performance indicators such as water depletion. Moreover, as of 2013, both countries generate approximately equal GHG emissions per kWh, and relatively low emission rates of other pollutants compared to nations of similar development levels. Although climate-centric policy can lead to some positive environmental outcomes in certain areas, energy policy-making should be holistic and include other aspects of sustainability and vulnerability.},

Currently, most research has focused on estimating the energy required to provide the DLS. However, no attempt has been made to estimate the material consumption needed to provide the DLS. Thus, we ask the following questions: First, what is the amount of materials in stocks and flows needed to provide a DLS? Second, which lifestyle and technology choices are effective in providing a DLS without creating an excessive demand for additional materials? To provide a DLS, a material footprint (MF) of 6 t/(cap*yr) with a lower and upper bound between 3 and 14 t/(cap*yr) is required. The direct and indirect in-use stocks required are estimated at 32 t/cap and 11 t/cap, respectively. Nutrition (39\%) and mobility (26\%) contribute the most to total MF. Buildings account for 98\% of direct stocks, while the construction sector accounts for 61\% of indirect stocks. We extend the coverage of the DLS by including the collective service dimension and link the material stock-flow-service nexus and life cycle assessment to compute the MF and in-use stocks needed to provide the DLS.},

The objective of the present work is to support prospective Swiss energy policy-making by providing a detailed sustainability analysis of possible energy system transformation pathways. For this purpose, the results of the scenario quantification with an energy system model are coupled with multi-criteria sustainability analysis. Two climate protection and one reference scenario are addressed, and the trade-offs between the scenarios are analysed based on a set of 12 interdisciplinary indicators. Implementing a stringent climate policy in Switzerland is associated with co-benefits such as less fossil resource use, less fatalities in severe accidents in the energy sector, less societal conflicts and higher resource autonomy. The availability and implementation of CCS allows for achieving the GHG emission reduction target at lower costs, but at the expense of a more fossil fuel-based energy system.},

To strive for the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) related to energy, their transformation must be initiated. Insights on the sustainability of energy system transformation pathways can be gained by combining partial equilibrium energy system modelling and life cycle assessment (LCA) due to their complementary characteristics. The present study aims at demonstrating an approach on how LCA indicators can be quantified for the integration in partial equilibrium energy system models without double-counting of impacts of the energy system and how such analyses can be used to estimate environmental and human health impacts of energy system transformation pathways. The results for the World Energy Scenarios show that the environmental and human health ``hotspots'' are coal (mining, heat and power generation, ash disposal), oil (freight and passenger transport, industrial motors) and biomass (cultivation, heat generation, ash disposal) technologies. The regional results are found to be more informative than the global results, also because many environmental and human health indicators reflect regional impacts. The transformation pathway with a focus on climate change mitigation policies has co-benefits regarding environmental and human health impacts and thus contributes to several SDGs, while it encounters challenges related to water and land use.},

  abstract = {Energy sector is one of biggest contributors to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. As a result, it has attracted considerable attention to reduce the GHG emissions of electricity production. Hydro-electric, nuclear and wind power are the top three clean energy in China. In this study, the environmental impacts of these three technologies are analyzed, assessed and compared via a life-cycle assessment approach. The entire life cycle, including the manufacturing, construction, operation and decommissioning stages is examined. Apart from global warming potential (GWP100) caused by GHG emissions, the environmental impacts assessed in this study also included acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) and human toxicity potential (HTP). The results show that wind power technology has the most significant environmental impacts amongst these three clean energies, followed by nuclear power and hydropower. For example, in terms of global warming potential, wind power produces 28.6 {\textpm} 3.2 g CO2-eq/kWh of GWP100 throughout its life cycle, which is higher than that of nuclear power (12.4 {\textpm} 1.5 g CO2-eq/kWh) and hydropower (3.5 {\textpm} 0.4 g CO2-eq/kWh). In addition, this study revealed that the the manufacturing stage is the largest contributor of environmental impacts for wind and hydropower. By contrast, the decommissioning stage is most significant for nuclear power in terms of environmental impacts. The comparative life cycle assessment method proposed in this study provides useful tool for the future environmental assessment of electricity production technologies. Findings of this study provide useful inputs for the sustainable transformation of the energy sector.},

  abstract = {Global energy transitions could fundamentally change flows of both minerals and energy resources over time. It is, therefore, increasingly important to holistically and dynamically capture the impacts of large-scale energy transitions on resource flows including hidden flows such as mine waste, as well as direct flows. Here we demonstrate a systematic model that can quantify resource flows of both minerals and energy resources under the energy transition by using stock-flow dynamics and the concept of Total Material Requirement (TMR). The proposed model was applied to the International Energy Agency's scenarios up to 2050, targeting 15 electricity generation and 5 transport technologies. Results indicate that the global energy transition could increase TMR flows associated with mineral production by around 200--900\% in the electricity sector and 350--700\% in the transport sector respectively from 2015 to 2050, depending on the scenarios. Such a drastic increase in TMR flows is largely associated with an increased demand for copper, silver, nickel, lithium and cobalt, as well as steel. Our results highlight that the decarbonization of the electricity sector can reduce energy resource flows and support the hypothesis that the expansion of low-carbon technologies could reduce total resource flows expressed as TMR. In the transport sector, on the other hand, the dissemination of Electric Vehicles could cause a sharp increase in TMR flows associated with mineral production, which could offset a decrease in energy resource flows. Findings in this study emphasize that a sustainable transition would be unachievable without designing resource cycles with a nexus approach.},

These issues have driven calls for alternative approaches and more reliable technology forecasting methods. Here, we use an approach based on probabilistic cost forecasting methods that have been statistically validated by backtesting on more than 50 technologies. We generate probabilistic cost forecasts for solar energy, wind energy, batteries, and electrolyzers, conditional on deployment. We use these methods to estimate future energy system costs and explore how technology cost uncertainty propagates through to system costs in three different scenarios. Compared to continuing with a fossil fuel-based system, a rapid green energy transition will likely result in overall net savings of many trillions of dollars---even without accounting for climate damages or co-benefits of climate policy.},

The comparison is done by a common monetary valuation of the three endpoints that are common to the three methods: human well-being, nature, and resources. Land use, global warming, and respiratory inorganic pollutants together make up between 86\% and 97\% of the overall impacts compared in all three methods. The overall monetarized impacts amount to 30\%, 28\%, and 165\% of the gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. Resource depletion, land use, and global warming explain 99.5\% of the positive deviation of ReCiPe2008, relative to the other two methods. The main causes for these differences are investigated and discussed, pointing to possibly questionable calculations and assumptions, for example, regarding the nonsubstitutability of resources and the very long relaxation time for transformed forestland in the relatively new ReCiPe2008 method, which leads us to recommend users to be cautious and critical when interpreting the results.

  abstract = {Building heating is one of the sectors for which multiple decarbonisation options exist and current geopolitical tensions provide urgency to design adequate regional policies. Heat pumps and hydrogen boilers, alongside alternative district heating systems, are the most promising alternatives. Although a host of city or country-level studies exist, it remains controversial what role hydrogen should play for building heating in the European Union compared with electrification and how blue and green hydrogen differ in terms of costs and environmental impacts. This work assesses the optimal technology mix for staying within planetary boundaries, and the influence of international cooperation and political restrictions. To perform the analysis, a bottom-up optimisation model was developed incorporating life cycle assessment constraints and covering production, storage, transport of energy and carbon dioxide, as well as grid and non-grid connected end-users of heat. It was found that a building heating system within planetary boundaries is feasible through large-scale electrification via heat pumps, although at a higher cost than the current system with abatement costs of around 200 {\texteuro}/ton CO2. Increasing interconnector capacity or onshore wind energy is found to be vital to staying within boundaries. A strong trade-off for hydrogen was identified, with blue hydrogen being cost-competitive but vastly unsustainable (when applied to heating) and green hydrogen being 2--3 times more expensive than electrification while still transgressing several planetary boundaries.

Practitioners generally make use of LCI databases for such data, and the ecoinvent database is the largest transparent unit-process LCI database worldwide. Since its first release in 2003, it has been continuously updated, and version 3 was published in 2013. The release of version 3 introduced several significant methodological and technological improvements, besides a large number of new and updated datasets. The aim was to expand the content of the database, set the foundation for a truly global database, support regionalized LCIA, offer multiple system models, allow for easier integration of data from different regions, and reduce maintenance efforts. This article describes the methodological developments.},

  abstract = {Current research underlines the benefits of digitalization to integrate renewable energy sources (RES) efficiently and to coordinate generation and supply. This development towards smart energy systems (SES) includes emerging use cases at the distribution grid level, e.g., smart charging strategies for electric vehicles or energy management systems in buildings. An environmental assessment of such, however, is challenging. The stan\- dardized Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approaches seem insufficient since SES are emerging systems at the interface of digitalization and energy with multiple intended and unintended environmental effects. This article aims to derive solution approaches for LCA professionals that investigate use cases enabled by information and communication technology (ICT), specifically in SES. To identify challenges during the first two phases of an LCA and solution approaches, we examine seven recent research projects and conduct a real-time Delphi workshop with LCA experts in the field of SES. As a result, the article provides approaches on setting up an LCA, filling data gaps, and methods to draw upon the long-term impacts of use cases in SES. Key findings include a modified taxonomy of potential environmental effects. Results show that systemic effects in SES have potentially the highest impact on the LCA, followed by effects caused by user behavior. Assessing these effects of `higher-order' poses an increased complexity. Determined solution approaches include combining the standardized LCA with energy system modeling or surveys on user behavior. Overall, this article reveals orientation strategies and recommendations to guide LCA professionals toward a holistic environmental assessment of use cases in SES.},

However, the uncertainty of IES reduces the supply flexibility and the complexity of different energy chains reduces the accuracy of carbon trading volume. Therefore, this study proposes a low carbon economic scheduling of IES considering life cycle assessment (LCA) and risk cost. First, the carbon emissions generated from different energy chain conversion processes in IES are analyzed by life cycle assessment method. Subsequently, the calculated carbon emission coefficients are introduced into the ladder-type carbon trading mechanism to further constrain the carbon emissions of IES. Specifically, the system risk is controlled using the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) theory to obtain the day-ahead dispatch strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified based on the modified IEEE 39-node electric network, 20-node gas network and 6-node heat network models.},

  abstract = {Coupling life cycle assessment (LCA) and energy systems models (ESM) is a suitable approach to assess energy systems from both life cycle and energy systems perspectives. However, methodological challenges need to be taken into account due to differences between both modeling approaches considering system boundaries, databases, and different levels of detail of their input data. This paper brings these challenges into discussion and introduces the Environmental Assessment Framework for Energy System Analysis (EAFESA), which enables to identify life cycle based non-climate environmental impacts of energy scenarios consistently. EAFESA is applied to analyze potential future decarbonized European electricity systems with a focus on flexibility options using ELTRAMOD as an example of an ESM to test the conceptual approach of combining ESM and LCA. The application confirms the importance and benefits of ``integrated thinking'' proposed by EAFESA, which allows minimizing the pitfalls of combining both models comprehensively. At the same time, EAFESA has the potential to bring awareness of issues not discussed among policy-makers. One example is the insight that the decarbonized electricity system will be accompanied by increased metal demand and urban land occupation.},

This article incorporates globalization, renewable energy development, and the digital economy into its research framework, investigates the relationship between globalization and renewable energy development, and explores the moderating effect of the digital economy, using panel data from countries along the Belt and Road (B\&R) from 2001 to 2018. It is found that globalization facilitates the development of renewable energy. The 1\% increase in globalization results in a 1.06\% increase in renewable energy development; the level of globalization has a significant effect on renewable energy development in high-income countries, upper-middle-income countries, and low-income countries, but not in lower-middle-income countries; the digital economy has a moderating effect on the impact of globalization on renewable energy development in countries along the B\&R. Simultaneously, the effect of globalization on renewable energy development in B\&R countries is influenced by the digital economy's single threshold effect, and the effect of globalization on renewable energy development is more pronounced when the level of digital economy development is less than the threshold of 0.061. The conclusions of this article have significant implications for the B\&R countries' sustainable development in the contexts of globalization and the digital economy.},

This study integrates Planetary Boundaries (PBs) with a life cycle assessment to explore the sustainability impacts of this transformative energy approach both na\- tionally and regionally. Utilizing a GIS-MCDA (Geographic Information System-Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) model, the analysis covers the period from 2025 to 2060, examining the seven major grid regions in China. Our findings reveal that under current energy production systems, no region can meet its basic energy needs without exceeding petabytes if existing energy production systems are maintained, thereby risking severe PBs transgressions. Simulations indicate that the adoption of the new power system could significantly mitigate these risks. Quantitative results show that, by 2050, the potential reduction in PB pressures could reach up to 30 \% at the national level and vary significantly across regions, depending on their specific energy transition strategies. These insights provide a vital scientific basis for future policy-making and optimization of power systems to safeguard environmental thresholds and promote sustainable development in China.},

  abstract = {Purpose Objective uncertainty quantification (UQ) of a product life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a critical step for decisionmaking. Environmental impacts can be measured directly or by using models. Underlying mathematical functions describe a model that approximate the environmental impacts during various LCA stages. In this study, three possible uncertainty sources of a mathematical model, i.e., input variability, model parameter (differentiate from input in this study), and model-form uncertainties, were investigated. A simple and easy to implement method is proposed to quantify each source. Methods Various data analytics methods were used to conduct a thorough model uncertainty analysis; (1) Interval analysis was used for input uncertainty quantification. A direct sampling using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was used for interval analysis, and results were compared to that of indirect nonlinear optimization as an alternative approach. A machine learning surrogate model was developed to perform direct MC sampling as well as indirect nonlinear optimization. (2) A Bayesian inference was adopted to quantify parameter uncertainty. (3) A recently introduced model correction method based on orthogonal polynomial basis functions was used to evaluate the model-form uncertainty. The methods are applied to a pavement LCA to propagate uncertainties throughout an energy and global warming potential (GWP) estimation model; a case of a pavement section in Chicago metropolitan area was used. Results and discussion Results indicate that each uncertainty source contributes to the overall energy and GWP output of the LCA. Input uncertainty was shown to have significant impact on overall GWP output; for the example case study, GWP interval was around 50\%. Parameter uncertainty results showed that an assumption of {\textpm} 10\% uniform variation in the model parameter priors resulted in 28\% variation in the GWP output. Model-form uncertainty had the lowest impact (less than 10\% variation in the GWP). This is because the original energy model is relatively accurate in estimating the energy. However, sensitivity of the model-form uncertainty showed that even up to 180\% variation in the results can be achieved due to lower original model accuracies. Conclusions Investigating each uncertainty source of the model indicated the importance of the accurate characterization, propagation, and quantification of uncertainty. The outcome of this study proposed independent and relatively easy to implement methods that provide robust grounds for objective model uncertainty analysis for LCA applications. Assumptions on inputs, parameter distributions, and model form need to be justified. Input uncertainty plays a key role in overall pavement LCA output. The proposed model correction method as well as interval analysis were relatively easy to implement. Research is still needed to develop a more generic and simplified MCMC simulation procedure that is fast to implement.},

  abstract = {In many fields one encounters the challenge of identifying, out of a pool of possible designs, those that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. This means that usually there is not one optimal design but an entire set of Pareto-optimal ones with optimal tradeoffs in the objectives. In many applications, evaluating one design is expensive; thus, an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is unfeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the Pareto Active Learning (PAL) algorithm which intelligently samples the design space to predict the Pareto-optimal set. Key features of PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as samples from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accomodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we show an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets. The results show PAL's effectiveness; in particular it improves significantly over a state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization method, saving in many cases about 33\% evaluations to achieve the same accuracy.},
